0,2025-11-05,"The amount of capital pouring into AI data center projects is staggering. Last week, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon reported their 2025 capital expenditures would total roughly $370 billion, and they expect that number to keep rising in 2026. The biggest spender last quarter was Microsoft, which put nearly $35 billion into data centers and other investments, equivalent to 45 percent of its revenue.
Rarely, if ever, has a single technology absorbed this much money this quickly. Warnings of an AI bubble are getting louder every day, but whether or not a crash eventually happens, the frenzy is already reshaping the US economy. Harvard economist Jason Furman estimates that investment in data centers and software processing technology accounted for nearly all of US GDP growth in the first half of 2025.
Today, we’re looking at how data centers are impacting three crucial areas: public markets, jobs, and energy.
The US stock market is booming, mostly thanks to AI. Since ChatGPT launched in November 2022, AI-related stocks have accounted for 75 percent of S&P 500 returns and 80 percent of earnings growth, according to JPMorgan’s Michael Cembalest. The question now is whether that growth will be sustainable as tech firms continue spending heavily on AI infrastructure.
At the start of this year, tech giants were financing their AI projects mostly with cash they had on hand. As financial journalist Derek Thompson pointed out, the ten largest US public companies kicked off 2025 with historically high free cash flow margins. In other words, their businesses were so profitable that they had billions of dollars sitting around to put towards Nvidia GPUs and data center buildouts.
That trend has largely continued through 2025. Alphabet, for example, told investors last week that its capital expenditures this year would be as much as $93 billion, an increase from its previous estimate of $75 billion. But it also reported that revenue was up 33 percent year over year. Put another way, Silicon Valley is both spending more and earning more. That means everything is fine, right?
Not exactly. For one thing, tech giants appear to be using accounting tricks to make their financials look rosier than they may really be in reality. A significant portion of AI investment flows to Nvidia, which releases new versions of its GPUs approximately every two years. But companies like Microsoft and Alphabet are currently estimating that their chips will last six years. If they need to upgrade sooner to stay competitive—a likely possibility—that could wind up eating into their profits and weaken their overall performance.
Some tech companies have spent so much on AI recently that they have been forced to look for new sources of funding. One noteworthy example is Meta, which recently announced a $27 billion deal to develop a cluster of data centers in Louisiana. The project was created through a special purpose vehicle (SPV), an increasingly common organizational structure that allows firms to avoid putting large amounts of debt on their balance sheets. Last week, Meta said it also raised another $30 billion in debt through a more conventional channel: selling corporate bonds.
A single data center may house tens of thousands of GPUs that can collectively perform trillions of operations in the course of an AI training run. That massive computing power generates intense heat, and the hardware needs to be cooled to keep running safely. As the race to build AI infrastructure accelerates, it’s placing intense pressure on the US energy grid.
Part of the problem is that the US simply isn’t building enough grid capacity to support all of the data centers currently being built. “I think it is very likely we will see a lot of these facilities constructed with computing equipment in place but there won’t be electrons to power these facilities, because the fuel resources aren’t in place,” says Zachary Krause, an energy analyst at East Daley Analytics who has studied the data center industry.
Because supply can’t keep pace with demand, energy prices are rising, especially in communities near data centers. In the first half of 2025, American utilities sought nearly $30 billion in rate increases, according to The New Yorker.
Last year, the US deployed 49 GW of renewable energy infrastructure, according to the American Clean Power Association. China, meanwhile, added 429 GW. The Chinese government is also reportedly offering generous energy subsidies to domestic tech giants like ByteDance and Alibaba to help keep their energy costs down.
In a letter sent to the White House last week, OpenAI warned that “limits on how much electricity the US can generate to power AI development” are threatening the country’s ability to maintain its global lead in artificial intelligence.
The data center boom is coinciding with a softening labor market. Private employers in the US added just 42,000 jobs in October, mostly in education and healthcare, according to the payroll processor ADP. Big tech companies, however, have been shedding workers, even as they report record profits. Amazon announced last week that it would eliminate 14,000 corporate roles and more cuts are expected soon. Microsoft, meanwhile, laid off about 15,000 people during two rounds of cuts in May and July.
While it’s easy to look at these trends and assume that AI is leading to widespread job loss, the story isn’t quite so simple. There’s some evidence that generative AI is eliminating entry-level roles in certain industries, like software engineering. Many companies are also eager to find ways to automate tasks that humans currently do. Amazon, for example, estimated that it could avoid hiring 160,000 people in the US by 2027 by relying on robots, according to internal documents reviewed by The New York Times.
But at least right now, the main factor impacting jobs isn’t necessarily AI itself, but the data centers powering it. Big companies and investors have a limited amount of capital to spend each year, and they’re putting the majority of it toward building data centers. That means less investment is flowing to other sectors like manufacturing, which lost 3,000 jobs last month according to ADP.

If you're a part of the Pixel crew like I am, you know that discounts on the latest generation are few and far between. That's why I'm pleased to share that the entire family of Pixel 10 phones, from the regular Pixel 10 all the way up to the recently released Pixel 10 Pro Fold, are all marked down by various amounts on Amazon.

Amazon
Amazon (XL)
Amazon (Pro)
Best Buy
Starting with the base model Pixel 10, you'll save $200 on both the 128 GB and 256 GB models in all four colors, bringing the prices down to $599 and $699, respectively. The base version of the Pixel 10 makes a few compromises to bring the price down, like foregoing the Pro model's vapor chamber for cooling and opting for a smaller camera sensor. It's still an excellent choice for casual Android enjoyers, particularly at the price, but power users and mobile gamers may want to think about upgrading to the Pro.
Like the regular 10, the Pixel 10 Pro is marked down by $250 across all sizes, but color availability does change a bit, particularly on the 1 TB model. The biggest difference between the two models are the higher-resolution screen, more memory, and the bigger and better camera sensors. You can also get the higher-storage models, while the regular Pixel 10 only goes up to 256 GB. The Pixel 10 Pro XL, which has the same specs as the 10 Pro but with a larger screen, is marked down by $300, again with some varying availability between color and storage size.

Finally, we have the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which just recently became available for purchase and is already marked down by a not-insignificant $300 for both the 256 GB and 512 GB models, and I even spotted both colors in stock at both sizes. It has not one, but two excellent displays, and feels premium and sturdy, even if it is missing some of the features found on the 10 Pro.
With discounts on a variety of Pixel 10 series phones, you might need a little more help deciding which one is for you. We have a handy guide that compares all the currently available Pixel phones, including the Pixel 9a, which is currently discounted as well. We also have an in-depth review comparing the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL specifically, which is worth a read for the extra details.

We all rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and keeping all of them charged can get challenging. This is especially true for those who are out and about often and canât afford to sit around waiting for one device to finish charging before plugging in the next. A multi-port, high-output charger can come in handy in these situations, and we just spotted a powerful option going for less on Amazon.
The 100W Baseus USB-C charger block is currently sitting at $29, after a massive 40% drop on its retail price of $49. Both color options (black and white) are discounted. Even better, you can score a free USB-C cable (valued at $8) with your purchase. To claim it, click on the âHow to claimâ link next to the Get 1 free item label on the product page. In the tab that opens, add the charger to your cart, then navigate to the Benefit Item section and add the USB-C cable to your cart as well.
See at Amazon
The charger comes with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so you can juice up to three devices at once. Using the single USB-C port gets you up to 100W of power, and when multiple devices are plugged in, Baseusâ BPS 3.0 smart power distribution automatically allocates the required output to each connected device.
Support for all major fast-charging protocols (PD 3.0, QC 3.0, and PPS) translates into efficient charging for a wide range of devices, whether itâs your smartphone, iPad, MacBook, or even Steam Deck. Thereâs thermal control built in, as well. Baseus Cooling Technology (BCT) monitors temperature consistently in real-time to prevent any overheating problems.
Itâs also 43% more compact than most chargers out there, so carrying it around wonât feel heavy. The pins fold down, so you can easily throw the block in your bag or even your pocket and get going. Itâs great for remote workers, travelling, plus convenient home use.
Itâs now going for just $30, and it also lets you grab a free USB-C cable with your purchase for absolutely nothing. These deals wonât be around for long, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.

The Galaxy XR headset launched just a few weeks ago in the US and South Korea with a $1,800 price tag. Samsung also launched a pair of controllers for its XR headset for an additional $250 or $175. However, shortly after the headset went live, these controllers were sold out due to high demand in the U.S.
The good news is that the Korean OEM has been busy restocking the controllers for the past few days. Considering people who've added the item to their wishlist or clicked on the ""Notify me"" button on Samsung's website are receiving emails stating that the"" Galaxy XR controllers are back in stock."" The email further stated that ""We have good news. An item you asked us to track is back in stock. Act fast, supplies are still limited.""
 



Samsung appears to be working on bringing back these popular controllers, but it seems like only select individuals in the U.S. have so far received restock notifications, while Samsung's official website still says these controllers are currently out of stock, with a ""It’s not you. It’s us. We can’t make them fast enough.""
While Samsung has been clear that the Galaxy XR headset's sole purpose isn't just gaming, like the Meta Quest series. However, without these controllers, it would be tough to dive into more immersive VR games or PC-VR content, as these games simply won't work without them.
 



The controllers are supposedly very ergonomic and are equipped with 6 DoF tracking technology and analog sticks, which deliver precise interactions in the 3D space for enhanced experiences. The Galaxy XR headset could be used for other things like mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or even entertainment. This is definitely a setback as users won't be able to experience the headset's other core functionality.
For now, gaming enthusiasts have to wait it out and make do by operating the Galaxy XR with a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software, as the company plays catch up.

Yesterday, the bitcoin price briefly dipped below the $100,000 mark for the first time since June. And due to the dynamics usually at play in terms of bitcoinâs four-year market cycles around halving events, where the amount of new bitcoin issued in each block is cut in half, many analysts are wondering if this latest crypto bull market is over.
Would be funny if people sold because they feared the 4 year cycle already peaked, just to see Bitcoin rip upwards for the next 12 months straight. ð¤
— Samson Mow (@Excellion) November 4, 2025

However, there are also those who claim âthis time is different,â and are expecting new all-time highs above $125,000 to be seen within the next year. Galaxy Head of Firmwide Research Alex Thorn has revised his expectations for an end of year bitcoin price from $185,000 down to $120,000 due to recent events, and heâs not the only analyst making that sort of adjustment. His recent note points to the likelihood of more moderate market cycles and lower volatility for bitcoin in the future relative to its past history of wild price wings.
While itâs always dangerous to be the person who is claiming things are going to be different this time around, the changing supply and demand dynamics around the bitcoin asset related to the massive infusion of capital from traditional financial institutions reinforces the possibility that the impact halving eventsâ have on price may be dwindling.
In past crypto market cycles, things have tended to get extremely overheated in terms of retail exuberance that eventually led to some disaster event that created extreme fear in the market. For example, the massive 2021 crypto bull market eventually led to overleveraging (and outright fraud) that culminated in the collapse and subsequent bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX. Four years earlier, it was the popping of the bubble in the initial coin offerings (ICOs) that marked the top of the market.
A few weeks ago, the crypto market experienced the largest liquidation event in its history, at least in nominal terms. And the fallout from that event where more than $20 billion in positions were wiped out is likely not yet fully understood.
Additionally, bitcoin treasury company Sequans recently sold part of its bitcoin stack to fund buybacks to support the stock price. A bitcoin treasury company is basically a company that uses debt to accumulate as much bitcoin as possible as quickly as possible. While other digital asset treasury companies have previously sold non-bitcoin crypto assets, Sequans may be the first example of a purely bitcoin-focused treasury company selling bitcoin, according to CoinDesk.
October 10 2025 was the largest liquidation event in the history of crypto by a big margin. an estimated $20-30b of positions were liquidated. the previous record was $8b. 
thus, it shouldn't be a surprise if a number of funds, incl. those with delta neutral strategies, areâ¦
— Hasuâ¡ï¸ð¤ (@hasufl) November 4, 2025

While Strategy invented this concept of a bitcoin treasury company during the last crypto market cycle, some analysts have worried about the viability of the large number of copycat companies that are also using debt to take leveraged positions on bitcoin and other crypto assets that have popped up over the past year or two.
These sorts of events combined with the timing roughly lining up with when the current cycle would be expected to endâbased on the four-year timeline of previous cyclesâhave plenty of analysts justifiably spooked.
Two fundamental reasons some analysts believe this time could be different and the four-year cycle may no longer be relevant are that institutions have brought a whole new level of liquidity to the bitcoin market and the effect halving events have on supply diminishes over time. As Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan stated earlier this year, âThe movement of assets into ETFs is a 5-10 year trend. It started in 2024 . . . Broader institutional adoption is just getting started (ETFs still being approved on national account platforms, pensions and endowments just now considering crypto, etc.).â
With the development of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the growing use of bitcoin as a reserve asset by major companies and even nation states (not in the leveraged manner as the aforementioned bitcoin treasury companies), itâs clear that the supply and demand dynamics at play here may be quite different than what was seen at lower price levels in previous cycles.
Great read, aligns with The Great Rotation idea I've covered over recent months
The sell-side pressure exerted by existing Bitcoin holders is tremendous

— _Checkmate ð ðâ¡â¢ï¸ð¢ï¸ (@_Checkmatey_) November 1, 2025

Another factor to consider is the general lack of a so-called âaltseasonâ so far this cycle, which is when smaller crypto assets start to massively outperform bitcoin in a market hysteria that usually marks the final stage of a crypto bull market. Bitcoin market dominance currently sits at 73.7%, according to Bitbo, which isnât far off the cycle high of 78.5%.
There are also signs that much of the more centralized aspects of the crypto industry could increasingly be merged into the existing, traditional fintech space, which may indicate a healthy move away from decentralization theater and towards a more mature market.

Mike Kostersitz spent 31 years building a career at Microsoft. Then, at age 60, he had to do something he hadn't done in decades: Find a job.
In May, Kostersitz, a principal product manager lead working on Azure, said his team had a meeting with a senior leader that seemed to go well. But the following morning, he noticed a high-priority meeting had been added to his calendar — and it didn't bring good news.
""Me and 120 other anonymous faces got told our jobs had been eliminated,"" said Kostersitz, who lives in Washington state. His manager and two of his direct reports were also affected, along with about 6,000 others.
Kostersitz said the layoff came as a total surprise, so he took the rest of the week to process it before beginning his job search. Over the last five months, he's landed interviews with a handful of companies, including Nvidia and Nike. He said there's one opportunity he's optimistic about, but that he still hasn't secured a job.
Kostersitz is among thousands of Microsoft workers who've been laid off over the past year. A company spokesperson previously told Business Insider the company was focused on reducing management layers and streamlining processes.
Microsoft isn't the only large tech company laying off workers. Amazon, Meta, and Google have also cut jobs. While overall layoffs remain low by historical standards, tech workers have been disproportionately affected, and a hiring slowdown across the industry has made it more challenging for many to secure new roles.
In a challenging environment, some workers are considering options outside Big Tech — whether taking a role at a smaller company, starting a business, or retiring early. Kostersitz shared how he approached his first job search in decades.
Business Insider has heard from dozens of tech workers about how corporate strategy shifts, layoffs, and hiring slowdowns have affected their careers. If you have a story to share about struggling to find work, contact this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, via Signal at jzinkula.29, or fill out this quick form.

In the days after his layoff, Kostersitz said his initial instinct wasn't to be angry with Microsoft. He'd spent more than half his life at the company and had built many connections there.
However, he wished the news had been delivered more personally.
""After 31 years, you would expect at least your manager or your VP or somebody to come to you and say, 'Hey Mike, this is going to happen and here is why.'""
Still, Kostersitz said he was grateful for Microsoft's ""55 and 15"" policy, which allows long-tenured employees who are at least 55 years old and have spent at least 15 consecutive years at the company to have their stock grants continue vesting even after their employment ends.
His Microsoft stock and savings gave him time to look for a new role, but he knew that cushion wouldn't last forever. Kostersitz said he and his wife can get by financially for about two years without tapping into their retirement accounts — thanks to savings, severance pay, and Microsoft stock.
As he struggled to find work, Kostersitz said he began thinking about whether an early retirement could be an option. Now 60, he'd tentatively planned to retire around 67, though he was open to working longer. However, he concluded that retiring now would be financially challenging for him and his wife.
""Technically, we could retire,"" he said. ""Would it be a huge change of lifestyle? Absolutely.""
Given that he'd spent the prior three decades at Microsoft, Kostersitz initially felt like a fish out of water in the job market.
Over the past two decades, he'd built teams — reviewing résumés, interviewing candidates, and making hiring decisions. But being on the other side of the table was unfamiliar.
So his first step was to hire a career coach to help him build a résumé, update his LinkedIn, draft cover letters, and optimize his materials for applicant tracking systems.
In addition to hiring a private coach, Kostersitz said Microsoft provided a career advisor as part of its layoff package. Kostersitz said the advisor recommended he ""de-age"" his résumé by removing roles from the 1980s and '90s. His LinkedIn profile now begins with work experience dating back to 2003.
Kostersitz began applying for jobs, targeting director-level roles in product or program management. He applied to tech companies like Google and Apple, as well as to tech roles at non-tech firms like Nordstrom.
He said he tried to secure referrals at some companies — and got one from a Nvidia employee that helped him land an interview — but said he struggled to get traction.
Kostersitz said one challenge during interviews is figuring out which parts of his career to highlight. He said he frequently gets ""tell me about a time when"" questions, and while he has decades of experience, it's difficult to know which examples will resonate.
""It's like, I have 30 years of stories for you. Which one do you want to hear?"" he said.
Despite these obstacles, Kostersitz hasn't given up. He said the Microsoft-provided advisor encouraged him to stick with his current strategy — and emphasized that job hunting in today's market is, in some ways, a test of endurance.
""They said it's a game of chicken right now. The person who has the longer breath and can stick it out longer will get the job.""

Tesla is facing a pivotal shareholder meeting.
On November 6, the EV maker will hold its annual meeting, where investors will vote on issues concerning the company's future direction and the performance of its CEO, Elon Musk.
The meeting comes as the company navigates a year marked by political controversies and struggling sales. Tesla's board also decided to exclude at least 11 shareholder proposals that focus on accountability and sustainability.
Although Tesla shares have largely recovered from the losses experienced between March and August, and the end of the EV tax credit boosted third-quarter vehicle sales, many investors have questions regarding Musk's leadership and the company's spending on AI.
From Musk's proposed $1 trillion pay package to an investment in xAI, here is what's at stake for Tesla and Musk at Thursday's shareholder meeting.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comments.
The battle over Musk's record-setting $1 trillion pay package has escalated into one of the most high-stakes corporate showdowns in years.
Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, warned shareholders in a letter in October that Musk could walk away from the company if they fail to approve the plan at Tesla's annual meeting next week. In her letter, Denholm said it comes down to whether shareholders still want to ""retain Elon as Tesla's CEO and motivate him"" to make Tesla ""the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company"" in the world.
The proposed pay package, potentially worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade, was introduced after a Delaware judge struck down Musk's previous $56 billion compensation plan twice. The judge wrote in the ruling that Tesla's board had been unduly influenced by Musk when it approved that 2018 deal, which was then the largest executive pay award in corporate history. As Tesla continues to appeal the judge's decision, Musk has remained without compensation.
To unlock the full payout, Musk must hit a series of ambitious milestones. According to Tesla's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the goals include raising Tesla's market capitalization to $8.5 trillion by 2035, selling 12 million vehicles annually, deploying one million robotaxis, and producing one million ""AI bots."" If successful, his stake in the company would grow from 13% to at least 25%.
The proposed pay package is a source of controversy among investors. Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject the proposal, arguing that it grants Musk excessive power with too little oversight. Meanwhile, Musk fired back, calling the firms ""corporate terrorists"" during Tesla's third-quarter earnings call.
""I just don't feel comfortable building a robot army here and then being ousted because of some asinine recommendations,"" Musk said.
As Tesla pushes deeper into robotics and AI, Musk wants shareholders to agree to an investment in his AI startup, xAI.
Musk had previously commented on X that if it were up to him, Tesla ""would have invested in xAI long ago.""
Founded in July 2023, xAI has rapidly become one of Musk's most valuable ventures. The company, which develops the Grok chatbot integrated into X, has raised over $12 billion across multiple funding rounds and was valued at about $50 billion in 2024.
In March, Musk announced that xAI had acquired X in an all-stock deal, valuing xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion. Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, had also announced plans earlier in the year to invest $2 billion into xAI.
Musk owns Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and The Boring Company, and many have dubbed his series of connected ventures the ""Muskonomy."" Some shareholders have previously told Business Insider that they are concerned about the interconnectedness of his ventures.
""There are already big conflicts of interest at play with Musk's roles at other companies like xAI,"" Kevin Thomas, CEO of Shareholder Association for Research and Education, told Business Insider.
""If this were a merger decision, at least we'd be looking at a single entity,"" Thomas added. ""But letting one CEO use a public company as a piggy bank for cash, talent, and chips for his own, privately-held companies isn't something the board or shareholders should condone.""
Although Tesla's board rejected many shareholder proposals that concern accountability, a few have made it to the ballot, according to the meeting agenda filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission:
Tesla's board has recommended against all of the accountability proposals.
The proposal to amend the bylaws, which limit derivative lawsuits to the largest shareholders, was filed by New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli.
""Tesla deceived shareholders by assuring that shareholder rights' would stay the same after the company's move to Texas but then immediately and unilaterally took these rights away,"" DiNapoli previously told Business Insider when his office filed the proposal in July. ""These actions violate basic tenets of good corporate governance and must be reversed.""

Michael Burry, the contrarian investor who called the 2008 financial crisis, is back with his unique blend of dire warnings, cryptic messages, winking memes, and pop-culture references.
The Scion Asset Management chief has returned to X after a two-year hiatus to sound the alarm on the AI boom. Where advocates see a revolutionary technology that will supercharge productivity and generate massive profits, he sees hype, speculation, and excess.
Burry, whose iconic bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was immortalized in the book and movie ""The Big Short,"" kicked off his comeback with a single, ominous post on Thursday.
""Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,"" he wrote.
The third sentence is a nod to the movie ""WarGames,"" where an AI supercomputer runs thousands of simulations of nuclear war and discovers all of them end in mutual destruction. Burry's quote underscores how perilous he believes today's market is for investors.
Signaling he'll be sticking around for a while, the famed forecaster has updated his profile picture and revised his bio to read: ""Cassandra Unchained: Missteps to Mayhem, Coming December 2025, Stay Tuned.""
That line is an apparent reference to the Greek myth of Cassandra, the Trojan priestess cursed to utter true prophecies but never to be believed, and to a speech Burry gave at Vanderbilt Medical Center in 2011 titled: ""Missteps to Mayhem: Inside the Doomsday Machine with the Outsider who Predicted and Profited from America's Financial Armageddon.""
Back then, Burry delivered a step-by-step breakdown of how the subprime mortgage bubble inflated, how he predicted and placed bets on its collapse, and how the fallout revealed glaring vulnerabilities in the US financial system.
""We must remember that entire societies can and often do follow the wrong path for a very long time, and that there is nothing wrong with breaking from the social norm to ensure good outcomes,"" Burry said. ""Sober analysis on the part of the individual is paramount.""
Positioning himself as a rebel who's speaking out against the AI mainstream, Burry swapped his banner image on X to a still from ""Star Wars: A New Hope,"" where Obi-Wan Kenobi uses a Jedi mind trick to deceive Imperial stormtroopers.
Referring to that meme, the Scion boss posted on Monday before the release of his firm's third-quarter portfolio update: ""These aren't the charts you are looking for. You can go about your business."" He attached three images offering fresh insight into why he's bearish on the AI frenzy.
Move along pic.twitter.com/ysPWozmnbt
The first chart showed that growth has slowed sharply in Amazon and Alphabet's cloud-computing divisions, and cooled slightly in Microsoft's rival unit.
The second highlighted that the US tech sector's capital expenditures have surged during the AI boom, echoing their spikes before the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis.
The third shows the circular dealmaking between Nvidia, OpenAI, Oracle, Microsoft, and other AI companies.
Burry nodded to the meme again in a follow-up post, writing ""Move along"" and attaching an image of a stormtrooper. He also shared a highlighted excerpt from ""Capital Account,"" a book that covers the dot-com bubble. It detailed how the telecoms boom and bust resulted in vast tracts of unused infrastructure, plunging prices, and the downfall of many high-valued companies that wound up scrambling for protection from creditors.
Burry's posts underline his skepticism about the AI boom. He appears to see shades of the dot-com bubble in the interwoven deals between tech titans, as they pour hundreds of billions of dollars into building huge amounts of infrastructure that might end up sitting idle if demand falters and valuations come crashing down, as they did 25 years ago.
The hedge fund manager backed up his words with two striking bets last quarter that were revealed on Monday. Scion purchased bearish put options on 1 million Nvidia shares and 5 million Palantir shares, with notional values of $187 million and $912 million, respectively.
The wagers dominated the firm's US stock portfolio, which had only eight holdings in total, including just four direct positions worth a combined $68 million.
Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, told Business Insider that Burry is ""clearly backing convictions with what can only be called a highly unconventional portfolio, with sizable short positions against both Nvidia and Palantir, both darlings of the current AI boom, to the tune of around $1 billion.""
Nvidia and Palantir fell 4% and 8% respectively on Tuesday. Burry's wagers drew the ire of Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who questioned why he was shorting companies that are ""making all the money.""
Both stocks have soared in price over the past few years; Nvidia became the first company to secure a $5 trillion market value last week, while Palantir was valued at nearly $500 billion at Monday's close — more than Mastercard, Exxon Mobil, or Netflix are worth.
The pair's valuations and high growth expectations could leave their stocks vulnerable to sharp declines if they disappoint, especially when investors are increasingly using margin and levered ETFs, Mould said.
Burry could win big if Nvidia and Palantir stumble, but the ""danger"" is that he ""gets run over by momentum and liquidity-fueled markets"" if they keep impressing investors and the Federal Reserve keeps cutting interest rates, Mould added.
Daniel Bustamante, the chief investor and founder of asset manager Bustamante Capital Management, told Business Insider that he broadly agrees with Burry's stance on AI stocks.
The Magnificent Seven's capital spending is ""already hurting earnings growth, retail is crowded into those names, and then margin debt is at all-time highs,"" he said. ""You basically have all tinder soaked in gas, and all it takes is a lit match at this point to cause some serious issues.""

If Plaud selling a million of its notetaking devices wasn’t enough to convince you that AI recorders are a real thing, maybe a ring will do the trick. Introducing the Stream Ring, a new AI recorder or “mouse for voice” from a startup called Sandbar, which puts its own (kind of creepy) spin on the idea.
The Stream Ring, is (duh) a ring that comes with a microphone and functions much in the same way as Plaud’s card-sized device. It records your voice at the push of a button and lets you record ideas or “moments of inspiration,” as Sandbar puts it. The difference? The Stream Ring, as a part of its onboarding process, listens to your voice and attempts to mimic it using a feature it calls “Inner Voice.” The idea here is that talking to the Stream Ring, which runs AI models in the cloud, will feel more like… talking to yourself.
“It creates the feeling of talking with yourself, a conversational layer designed to sound like you, allowing you to develop ideas more naturally and intuitively,” Sandbar states in a press release. Sure! That’s one way to characterize the idea of talking to yourself at length.
Outside of that fairly strange choice of using AI to mimic your voice, the Stream Ring functions similarly to other AI notetaking devices. To record, you hold the ring up to your mouth and press a touchpad on the device to capture your thoughts (Sandbar says it only records when you want it to), which is then confirmed by haptic feedback. All of your recordings are accessible in an app (called Stream) afterward, where you can view and edit your conversations. Sandbar claims that all of your recordings are encrypted both when they’re stored and when they’re being transferred to servers, but as always, you use a device like this at your own risk. If all of your voice notes get hacked at some point, don’t say I didn’t tell you so.
Sandbar also hasn’t shared any tech specs. How long is the battery life for this AI recorder ring? We have no idea yet.
Unlike Plaud, Sandbar isn’t crowdfunded via Kickstarter and is actually using venture funds raised by its founders, former members of CTRL-Labs, a neural band startup that was acquired by Meta (then Facebook) in 2019 for between $500 million and $1 billion, according to CNBC. To give you even more of an idea of how apparently popular the AI recorder market is becoming, it’s worth noting that Sandbar has already raised $13 million to make its Stream Ring, which decidedly ain’t nothin’ for a fairly niche-seeming device.
Clearly, Sandbar sees itself a little differently than upstarts like Plaud, though, which focuses more on productivity as opposed to creativity and “expanding your capacity to think,” which are sentiments that Sandbar mentions frequently in its description of the Stream Ring. One thing that seems to be unavoidable in any iteration of these devices is that they come saddled with a subscription if you want to get the most out of the recorder.
The Stream Ring comes in either silver or gold and is available for preorder at $249 and $299, respectively. Sandbar says the Stream Ring will start shipping in summer 2026. Sandbar is also upselling a version of its app called Stream Pro, which gives users unlimited notes and chats, as well as early features. Sandbar is including three months free, but after that it will cost you $10 per month (but only for “early customers”). No word on how much the app subscription will cost if you’re not. There’s a free tier, too, though, if you feel like you don’t need that much storage.

17,2025-11-05,President Donald Trump got a serious warning from voters that he’s out of touch with their fears about a deteriorating U.S. economy.  Democrats were able to ...
18,2025-11-05,"To our younger readers, a car without an all-touchscreen “infotainment” system may look clunky and dated, but really, you kids don’t know what they’re missing. Buttons, knobs, and switches all offer a level of satisfying tactility and feedback that touchscreens totally lack. [Garage Builds] on YouTube agrees; he also doesn’t like the way his aftermarket Kenwood head unit looks in his 2004-vintage Nissan. That’s why he decided to take matters into his own hands, and hack the buttons back on.
Rather than source a vintage stereo head unit, or try and DIY one from scratch, [Garage Builds] has actually hidden the modern touchscreen unit behind a button panel. That button panel is actually salvaged from the stock stereo, so the looks fit the car. The stereo’s LCD gets replaced with a modern color unit, but otherwise it looks pretty stock at the end.
Adding buttons to the Kenwood is all possible thanks to steering-wheel controls. In order to make use of those, the touchscreen head unit came with a little black box that translated the button press into some kind of one-wire protocol that turned out to be an inverted and carrier-less version of the NEC protocol used in IR TV remotes. (That bit of detective work comes from [michaelb], who figured all this out for his Ford years ago, but [Garage Builds] is also sharing his code on GitHub.)
Having the protocol, it simply becomes a matter of grabbing a microcontroller to scan the stock buttons and output the necessary codes to the Kenwood head unit. Of course now he has extra buttons, since the digital head unit has no tape or CD changer to control, nor AM/FM radio to tune. Those get repurposed for the interior and exterior RGB lighting [Garage Builds] has ̶i̶n̶f̶l̶i̶c̶t̶e̶d̶  mounted on this ̶p̶o̶o̶r̶ lovely car. (There’s no accounting for taste. Some of us love the look and some hate it, but he’s certainly captured an aesthetic, and now has easy control of it to boot.) [Garage Builds] has got custom digital gauges to put into the dash of his Nissan, and some of the extra buttons have been adapted to control those, too.
The whole car is actually a rolling hack as you can see from the back catalog of the [Garage Builds] YouTube channel, which might be worth a look if you’re in the intersection of the “electronics enthusiast” and “gearhead” Venn Diagram.
There’s no accounting for taste, but we absolutely agree with him that making everything black rectangles is the death of industrial design.
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen retro radios hacked together with micro-controllers; take a look at this one from a 1970s Toyota. Now that’s vintage!
Odd enough, back in the 00’s the all screen black control panel of death was peddled as the must have option for the very rich people
Cool project,Not exactly the button interface I was hoping for…. I want buttons on the newer car screen… like a can-bus interface that just adds all the physical buttons back (at least the new car has heater controls, Im looking at you id.4). It is almost to the point of using Bluetooth with some type of physical button and minimal screen draped over the factory ugly giant table in the middle of the car.
Yeah, I hear you. For the stereo portion, the “match the signals from the steering wheel controls” trick he’s using should work, but the giant rectangle of death does a lot more than just play music these days.
How long until someone makes a touchscreen robot arm specifically designed to interact with touchscreens while itself being controlled by something more human friendly? (It might also need a camera to keep in sync with the screen controls.)
One of the reasons I got my car when I did, was because the upcoming model was going completely touch screen (bigger), even replacing the environment controls :( .  Yuck.  So I guess, instead of keeping eyes on the road and turning up heat with a knob by feel… you have have to look and tap/slide … yuck…  I guess it is ‘cheaper’ to do it in software, then have physical knobs/sliders….
I could have bought the next year model of the vehicle I bought, both were available. You know what? I didn’t want the feature differences.
Touch screens aren’t an improvement in a vehicle. Physical buttons are preferred.
Even the typical glass-cockpit airline has a lot of physical controls for key things.

In medicine, there’s almost no such thing as a free lunch. Just about every drug or intervention will have its side effects.
Ideally, rigorous studies and the regulatory process will ensure that an approved drug’s benefits clearly outweigh any potential harms. But sometimes, researchers (and patients) will uncover side effects that went unnoticed during the approval process. Other times, more rarely, a drug’s maker is revealed to have buried incriminating information about their drug’s harms from the public or to have created a product that doesn’t work at all as intended. And when that happens, a bad or ineffective treatment can spark a major scandal.
There’s no shortage of pharmaceutical scandals that have occurred over the years, but to keep things short, let’s just focus on some of the biggest ones to have happened in this quarter-century.
For decades, people had unsuccessfully tried to sue J&J over its consumer products containing talc, particularly baby powder, claiming that the products had contributed to their cancers.
In 2018, however, an explosive report from Reuters found the company had hidden evidence that the talc it used could sometimes contain detectable levels of asbestos, a known carcinogen. The report helped fuel a new wave of lawsuits and growing public distrust in the company’s baby powder products. In the years since, the company has repeatedly lost civil suits over its talc products, some totaling into the billions, and its appeals continued to fail, even before the Supreme Court.
Though J&J has maintained that its products are safe, the company eventually removed talc from all its powder brands (instead using cornstarch), tried and failed to cover its liability over these lawsuits by having a subsidiary declare bankruptcy, and even this year has continued to lose court cases tying its products to people’s cancer.
Johnson & Johnson Forced to Pay $2.1 Billion in Baby Powder Cancer Case After Supreme Court Denial
Interestingly enough, though asbestos is known to cause cancer, pastÂ research hasnât found a clear link between talc as a whole (including asbestos-free talc) and cancer, and there remains some disagreement over the extent of the risk posed by talcum powder products. The American Cancer Society states that if talc can raise a person’s risk of ovarian cancer (the primary type of cancer linked to talc), the “overall increase is likely to very be small” for an individual woman. The World Health Organization has stated that asbestos-containing talc should be considered carcinogenic, while talc in general is “probably carcinogenic.”
In June 2021, the FDA approved Biogen and Eisai’s antibody-based Alzheimer’s drug Aduhelm. At first glance, the approval should have been good news: the first drug of its kind, and one intended to actually target a key driver of the degenerative disorder, beta amyloid. But in actuality, it was anything but.
In a rare move at the time, the FDA went against the recommendations of its expert advisory panel, who voted against approval. The outside experts rightly noted that the data supporting the drug’s effectiveness was mixed at best. The FDA alsoÂ granted Aduhelm accelerated approval, a special category that requires less rigorous evidence. Media outlet STAT News later uncovered an unusually friendly relationship between top Biogen employees and FDA officials, which prompted a Congressional investigation into the matter. And to add insult to injury, Biogen initially set Aduhelm’s list price at $56,000 a yearâa cost high enough to potentially devastate the pockets of patients and Medicare if the drug saw widespread use among older Americans.
It’s Finally Over for Aduhelm, the Sketchy Alzheimer’s Drug Everyone Hated
Many doctors soon rebelled against the approval, refusing to prescribe it to their patients, while Medicare decided to severely restrict its coverage of the drug. Biogen eventually gave up trying to make Aduhelm a thing, following years of poor sales, and pulled the drug from the market in early 2024.
This saga does have a bit of a happy ending, at least. There have been other similar drugs developed and approved in recent years, and unlike Aduhelm, these drugs do seem to have a real, if still modest, effect on treating the condition.
Purdue Pharma has perhaps become the most infamous poster child for the opioid crisis.
Its blockbuster drug, OxyContin, helped fuel growing rates of opioid use disorder following its release to the public in 1996. And though there are many drivers of the crisis, including the proliferation of more potent agents like fentanyl in later years, the company did eventually admit to downplaying the addictive risk of its products, paying doctors illegal kickbacks to prescribe their drugs, and turning a blind eye to the widespread diversion of its drugs from pharmacies to the black market.
Drug Overdose Deaths in America Have Finally Stopped Climbing
Following a glut of civil and federal lawsuits over OxyContin, Purdue Pharma shuttered its doors, and its sole ownersâthe Sackler familyâagreed to pay out more than $4 billion as part of a far-reaching settlement in 2021. The courts bumped this up to $6 billion in 2023. That settlement, however, also provided immunity from further civil charges against the Sacklers themselves. And though the situation has finally started to improve as of late, roughly 50,000 Americans still died from opioid overdoses last year.
Sometimes the scandals aren’t about the drugs themselves, but what they’re being sold for.
In 2015, Martin Shkreli became public enemy number one when his company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the anti-parasitic and anti-HIV drug Daraprim and raised its $13.50 price tag per pill by over 5,000 percent. Shkreli’s cocky, unrepentant attitude toward his many critics earned him the nickname of the “Pharma bro.”
Ironically enough, his initial downfall had nothing to do with Daraprim. Soon after he became infamous, federal prosecutors in New York charged Shkreli with securities fraud, and in 2017, he was convicted and sentenced to seven years of federal prison.
Who Asked for This: Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli Releases Medical ChatGPT Knockoff
Though Shkreli was released early in 2022, his company’s management of Daraprim did later come back to bite him. In 2020, the FTC and others sued the company, now called Vyera Pharmaceuticals after Shkreli’s imprisonment, alleging that it carried out an “elaborate anticompetitive scheme” to maintain its monopoly on the drug. The company reached a settlement with the FTC a year later, and the legal battle eventually required Shkreli himself to pay out a $64 million fine and to stay away from the pharmaceutical industry entirely. In 2023, Vyera declared bankruptcy and sold the rights to Daraprim. Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court snubbed Shkreli’s attempt to dismiss his personal fine and ban.
Don’t feel too bad for Shkreli, though. Since his release from prison, he’s been busy trying to shill crypto and AI knockoffs of WebMD.
In early 2022, the FDA warned families to stay away from certain powdered baby formulas produced by the company Abbott Nutrition. The products, it turns out, were contaminated by Cronobacter bacteria.
Several children were hospitalized, and two infants who had consumed the products later died. Abbott issued a widespread recall of its products and shut down its formula production facility in Sturgis, Michigan. The FDA’s investigation concluded that Abbott had failed to maintain sanitary conditions and that the facility had at least eight recent instances of Cronobacter contamination dating back to 2019.
It would take four months for the company’s Sturgis plant to reopen, following an agreement with the FDA to overhaul its safety practices, the length of which helped contribute to a nationwide formula shortage that year. Lawmakers on both sides also criticized the FDA for its delayed response to the crisis, since the agency first caught wind of potential issues as early as September 2021.
Though there haven’t been similar recalls or reported outbreaks since, an extensive ProPublica report in April 2025 interviewed workers who claimed that theÂ Sturgis plant continues to have serious safety and sanitary risks to this day. One employee reported what they found to the FDA, but it’s unclear whether the new Trump administration will take action.
Elizabeth Holmes founded the company Theranos in 2003. It centered around the development of a device intended to make blood tests easier than ever. With just a few drops of blood from a single finger prick, Holmes claimed, her company’s “Edison” device could accurately detect a litany of health conditions. By the mid-2010s, Holmes’ marketing of Theranos had allowed her to become a darling of the biotech world: a young, self-made entrepreneur styled after Steve Jobs, who at one point was worth nearly $5 billion.
The trouble was, as the world eventually found out, it was all based on falsehoods. Starting in late 2015, Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou exposed the fraudulent practices of Holmes and Theranos. Though Holmes had struck a partnership with retail chain Walgreens in 2013 to provide the Edison device to its customers, the Edison could simply never do what Holmes claimed it could. And eventually, the company secretly resorted to using other commercially available machines to perform most of its blood testing services.
Holmesâ deception didnât just mislead investors; several people reported that the faulty test results provided by Theranos made them fearful about having medical conditions they didn’t actually have, such as HIV, or otherwise harmed their health.
Holmes was convicted of investor fraud and other charges over Theranos in 2022 and was sentenced to an 11-year stint in prison (later reduced by two years), while her co-executive and one-time romantic partner Ramesh âSunnyâ Balwani was sentenced to nearly 13 years the next month. As of this year, she’s made her return to social media (via having someone else post her words).

            Michael Burry, the famed investor behind “The Big Short,” is betting artificial intelligence is more of a bubble than a revolution.
    

            Burry’s fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed on Monday that it bought puts — bets that share prices will fall — on two stars of the AI wave: Nvidia (NVDA) and Palantir (PLTR). Scion bought roughly $187.6 million in puts on Nvidia and $912 million in puts on Palantir, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
    

            Burry is known for his prophetic call that the US housing market would collapse in 2008. He was profiled in the 2010 book “The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine,” by Michael Lewis, and portrayed by Christian Bale in the 2015 film adaptation.

            Now Burry is betting against the hottest AI stocks on the market at a time when concerns are mounting about a bubble. Tech and AI stocks have carried the market in recent months.  The S&P 500, which is increasingly concentrated in tech companies, is trading at historically expensive levels.
    

            Meanwhile, the circular financing of AI deals has raised eyebrows on Wall Street, with many tech companies entwined in a massive web of deals with each other. Some investors are also skeptical whether future profit growth will continue to justify the enormous amounts of spending taking place.
    

            The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.04% on Tuesday, posting its worst day since August. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 fell 1.17%.
    

            Burry made a splash among investors on Thursday, when he posted on X for the first time since 2023. In his post, he shared a photo of Bale portraying him in “The Big Short” and wrote: “Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.”
    

            Four days later, Burry’s fund disclosed its bearish positions in Nvidia and Palantir. The SEC filings are for the third quarter of this year. Scion Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment.
    

            Angelo Zino, a tech analyst at CFRA Research, said a pullback in tech stocks was overdue, given how far they have rallied in recent months. He said Burry’s comments likely exacerbated concerns.
    

            Burry has made public calls about the market in the years since “The Big Short.” He has not always been correct. The hedge fund manager in January 2023 infamously posted on X, “Sell,” before posting two months later, “I was wrong to say sell.”
    

            Nonetheless, his words carry weight on Wall Street.
    
Sometimes, we see bubbles.Sometimes, there is something to do about it.Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play. pic.twitter.com/xNBSvjGgvs

            Burry’s return to social media comes at a time when investors have voiced concerns about expensive valuations, a market concentrated on a handful of large companies and rising investor expectations.
    

            For example, Palantir beat Wall Street forecasts in earnings reported Monday. Yet it wasn’t enough to impress traders after a series of strong earnings results.
    

            On Tuesday, its shares tumbled 7.95% — their worst day since August.
    

            Palantir was the top performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2024 and is in the top five performing stocks this year. Its shares are still up 152% this year.
    

            The company’s earnings results on Monday were “stellar,” according to CFRA Research’s Zino, but the company’s valuation — a measure of how pricey it is — “is a bit extreme.”
    

Why the Goldman Sachs CEO isn’t buying the AI jobs freakout


            “Despite the great results, when you coincide that with the comments that Michael Burry made and everybody already talking about concerns about an AI bubble, I think the combination of those factors really helped drive a pullback in the shares, the broader tech index and as a result the broader markets,” Zino said. “We’re not overly concerned about the pullback, but I would say it’s one of those situations where you’ve got to keep an eye on it.”
    

            Meanwhile, Nvidia shares fell 3.96% on Tuesday. Shares are still up 48% this year.
    

            Alex Karp, CEO at Palantir, told CNBC on Tuesday that people betting against the company — including Burry — are “crazy.”
    

            “When I hear short sellers attacking what I believe is clearly the most important software company in America, therefore in the world, in terms of our impact, … it just is super triggering,” Karp said.
    

            “It’s crazy motivating,” Karp said. “Every time they short us, we are just like tripling down on getting the better numbers, in part honestly, to make them poorer.”

In a surprising move, Grayscale has decided to pause sponsor fees and reduce staking costs on its Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL). The measure represents an incentive designed to draw fresh institutional inflows.
The goal is simple: to make Solana as appealing to institutions as Bitcoin and Ethereum once were in their early days of adoption.
Grayscale has suspended fees on its Solana Trust for three months or until it reaches $1 billion in assets, whichever comes first. The decision forms part of a broader strategy to adapt to shifting institutional investor behavior in the digital asset market.
In recent weeks, Bitcoin and Ethereum products have seen nearly $800 million in outflows, as large funds rebalance portfolios. In contrast, Solana has quietly recorded consecutive days of inflows, suggesting institutional investors are beginning to explore alternative blockchain networks.

By removing fees and boosting staking rewards, Grayscale aims to accelerate this emerging momentum around Solana. 
The Solana Trust now stakes 100% of its SOL holdings, producing a 7.23% annual yield and returning 95% of staking rewards directly to investors. For now, GSOL stands out as one of the most cost-efficient and investor-focused products in the digital asset landscape.
Solana’s appeal continues to grow thanks to its speed, low transaction costs, and increasingly active ecosystem of decentralized applications. It has evolved from a niche blockchain into a fundamental dynamic player in DeFi, NFTs, and broader on-chain innovation.
The network’s recent technical upgrades and improved reliability have restored confidence, following earlier outages that raised questions about its scalability.  At the same time, Solana’s strong community-driven activity has attracted both retail and institutional interest.
Grayscale just paused sponsor fees for $GSOL – aiming to boost investor participation and grow AUM faster.The fee waiver runs for 3 months or until AUM hits $1B.Quick look:• Net assets: $88.6M (as of Nov 4)• Market share: 0.10% of SOL• Staking: 100% SOL staked, earning… pic.twitter.com/fFjVeq4YDv
Grayscale’s new initiative appears designed to harness that momentum. 
By offering a regulated and accessible investment vehicle, it allows traditional investors to participate in Solana’s growth without directly managing crypto assets.
Success, however, is far from guaranteed.
Institutional investors continue to prioritize liquidity, regulatory clarity, and long-term network stability. These are areas where Solana is still maturing compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum.
Even so, the trust’s revamped structure could set a benchmark for how digital asset managers compete for institutional capital in the next market phase. If inflows accelerate, this could mark a pivotal moment, establishing Solana as the third cornerstone of institutional crypto exposure, after Bitcoin and Ethereum.
For now, Grayscale’s message is unmistakable: it’s not just supporting Solana; it’s going all in. This confident bet could redefine the next chapter of institutional crypto investment.

26,2025-11-05,"Zohran Mamdani, the newly elected mayor of New York City, is notable in many ways. He will become the city's youngest mayor since 1892, its first Muslim mayor and its first mayor born in Africa.
The 34-year-old entered the race last year with next to no name recognition, little money and no institutional party support.
That alone makes his victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa remarkable. 
But more than that, he represents the kind of politician that many in the Democratic Party's left have been seeking for years.
He is young and charismatic, with his generation's natural comfort with social media. 
His ethnicity reflects the diversity of the party's base. He hasn't shied away from a political fight and has proudly espoused left-wing causes - such as free childcare, expanded public transportation and government intervention in free market systems. 
Mamdani has also shown a laser-like ability to focus on the kind of core economic issues that have been a priority for working-class voters who have drifted from the Democratic Party recently, but he hasn't disavowed the left's cultural principles.
But critics have warned that such a candidate is unelectable in broad swathes of America - and Republicans have gleefully held the self-avowed democratic socialist up as the far-left face of the Democratic Party. Still, on Tuesday night in New York City, he was a winner.
By running against and defeating Cuomo, a former New York governor who is himself the son of a governor, he has vanquished the entrenched Democratic establishment viewed by many on the left as woefully out of touch with their party and their nation.
Because of this, Mamdani's campaign for mayor has generated voluminous media attention, perhaps more than a municipal election, even one for America's largest city, deserves.
It also means that, as mayor, his successes - and failures - will be closely scrutinised.
Twelve years ago, Democrat Bill de Blasio won his race for mayor on a platform of addressing New York City's economic and social inequalities. Like Mamdani, Americans on the left had high hopes that his administration would provide a national example of effective liberal governance. 
De Blasio, however, departed office eight years later widely unpopular and with a mixed record of achievements as he struggled with the limits of his mayoral power to implement new policies.
Mamdani will have to grapple with those same limits - and those same expectations.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat, has already said she opposed raising the kind of taxes necessary to fund Mamdani's ambitious agenda. 
And even with sufficient funding, Mamdani would not be able to implement programmes unilaterally.
He campaigned as a sharp critic of the corporate and business elite that call New York City their home, and have made Manhattan the financial capital of the world. To effectively govern, he will probably have to make some form of peace with those interests, however - a process he has already begun in recent weeks.
He has also condemned Israel's conduct during the Gaza war and pledged to arrest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a war criminal if he sets foot in New York City, a promise that could be tested at some point during his term.
All those are problems for a later date, however. For now, Mamdani will need to set about the task of defining himself on the public stage - before his opponents do. 
While his campaign has generated national attention, he is still a blank slate for much of America.
A recent CBS poll indicated that 46% of the American public were following the New York mayoral election ""not closely at all"". That provides both an opportunity and a challenge for Mamdani and the American left. 
Conservatives from US President Donald Trump down will be trying to paint the newly elected mayor as a socialist menace, whose policies and priorities will bring ruin to America's largest city and present a danger if embraced by the nation as a whole. 
They will amplify every stumble and highlight every negative economic indicator or crime statistic.
Trump, who has a personal connection to New York, is sure to welcome a political tussle with Mamdani and he has a wealth of ways to complicate life for the new mayor.
Mamdani will also be pressed to win over Democratic leaders, like New York senator and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who never backed his campaign.
The opportunity for Mamdani, however, is that he is not burdened by his past, which his political opponents unsuccessfully tried to wield against him during the campaign. 
When he is inaugurated in January, he will have the chance to build his political reputation from scratch. And if Trump does feud with him, he will only give Mamdani a larger platform on which to work.
His political talent and abilities have taken him this far, which is no small feat. But that is nothing compared to the tests that await him in the years ahead.
New Yorkers like to think their city is the centre of the universe, but its mayoral race was not the only electoral contest taking place on Tuesday. In fact, in all likelihood it wasn't even Tuesday's best indication of the current electoral mood.
Both New Jersey and Virginia - states Democrat Kamala Harris narrowly carried against Trump in last year's presidential contest - held elections for governor. And in both cases, the Democrats won by more comfortable margins. 
Of the two, the New Jersey contest was closer. Yet the results suggest the inroads Trump made in the state last year among working class and minority voters did not hold up without the president's name on the ballot.
Unlike Mamdani, Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger ran establishment-backed centrist campaigns with more modest policy prescriptions. All three, however, focused on affordability and cost-of-living issues. Exit polls showed the economy, once again, was the topic voters cared about most.
With Democrats on the left and centre winning on Tuesday, it may prove difficult for those looking to glean some insight on the kind of policies and candidates Democrats should advance to ensure future electoral success.
Last week, however, Mamdani insisted there was plenty of room in the party for all kinds of viewpoints.
""I think this has to be a party that actually allows Americans to see themselves in it and not just be a mirror image of just a few people who are engaged in politics,"" he said. 
""To me, what binds all of us together is who we are fighting to serve, and that is working people.""
That view will be put to test next year, as Democrats across the nation head to the polls to select their candidates for the congressional midterm elections. Tensions are sure to mount and traditional fault lines could re-emerge.
For one night, however, the Democrats are one big, happy party.
At least 12 people are dead and others wounded after UPS flight 2976 burst into flames and hit buildings during take-off. 
Surviellance footage shows one of the plane's engines falling off during takeoff before the fatal crash, officials say. 
President Trump promised to bring down inflation. One year on from his victory, BBC Verify revisits some of his claims.
The Democrat cited political violence and polarisation as reasons why he no longer wishes to serve in office.

27,2025-11-05,"The Galaxy XR headset will reportedly expand beyond South Korea and the U.S., reaching more global markets in 2026.

Samsung's first-ever Android XR headset, the Galaxy XR, is currently available only in a few select countries. However, according to a report, Samsung is planning a global expansion for its Apple Vision Pro competitor, with more countries joining the list next year.
At present, Samsung's Galaxy XR is available only in its home country, South Korea, and in the U.S. Other regions, such as Europe and parts of Asia, were missing from Samsung's list of available markets when the headset launched. A new report, however, from SamMobile claims that Samsung plans to launch the Galaxy XR in four additional countries in 2026.
According to the report, the next countries in line to get the Galaxy XR headset will be Germany, France, Canada, and the UK. The report does caution that the ""list may not be final,"" and Samsung could add or remove countries as production of the headset expands and more mixed reality apps become available.
 



Like the Apple Vision Pro, Samsung appears to be taking a gradual approach with the Galaxy XR headset. Apple's headset also launched only in the U.S. initially before its global rollout, and now Samsung seems to be following a similar strategy.
Even though the Galaxy XR costs almost half as much as the Apple Vision Pro at $1,800, given the limited demand for such products out there, Samsung seems to be taking a cautious approach.
That said, the Galaxy XR is the first Android XR headset to officially reach the market. It's powered by the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset, and thanks to its ultra-high-resolution displays and Android XR platform, it can run nearly any Android app in real space with floating windows and multitasking support.
It's a great device not only for streaming videos and content but also as a solid replacement for monitors and TVs, thanks to its ultra-high-resolution displays, as noted by our own Nicholas Sutrich.

Indiana Jones is always on the hunt for rare antiquities. He’s found the Golden Idol, Ark of the Covenant, Holy Grail, and so much more. All of which makes prop replicas of those things rather obvious. But, for the Indiana Jones fan who wants to be like their favorite adventuring archaeologist and get something more rare and specific, how about a clothes hanger?
Yes, next week, Regal Robot is releasing maybe the most random, deep-cut, funniest Indiana Jones prop replica ever, Toht’s hanger from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Here’s a brief reminder of what specifically that is.
The scene is a perfect reminder of why Raiders of the Lost Ark is so good. It’s a film that can fit such goofy, weird, unique jokes into a scene that’s otherwise tense and unpredictable. That’s part of why Regal Robot founder Tom Spina decided to make it the latest addition to the company’s already awesome list of Indy collectibles.
“You’re trying to find pieces that we haven’t seen done over and over and trying to give fans something that they’re just not going to get anywhere else,” Spina told io9 recently. “Ideas just pop out as we’re discussing, and when you get to something like the hanger, it’s just a classic film moment. How do you not look at that as something to do?”
After getting Lucasfilm’s permission to move forward, Regal’s team went ahead with researching the hanger itself. The original prop, made by the late, great Lucasfilm prop master Bill Hargreaves (who also made IG-88 and the Probe Droid in The Empire Strikes Back), was actually first supposed to be used in Steven Spielberg’s 1941 but didn’t quite make the cut. Spielberg loved the gag, though, and brought it back for Raiders.
As for where the prop went after that, Spina confirmed Regal was able to locate the screen-used original (though wouldn’t confirm specifically where) and from it acquired “never-before-seen imagery of that original prop, which we were able to use to scale from that to match size and detail,â Spina said.
Once they had those materials, a few interesting things came to light. First, the piece itself was not what they envisioned. “In my head I always sort of visualized it as black wood dowels with eyelets and a chain between them, rather than what it really is, which is metal tubing and chain running through and little rings as stoppers and things like that,” Spina said.
That, however, was the easy part. The hard part was the hook at the top, which wasn’t like anything they’d seen before. “We’ve done a bunch of research into it because it clearly was a found part of some kind, and we have a few leads,” Spina said. “We’re still trying to figure out what that original part might have been, but what we wound up doing for this replica is doing custom machine parts that match the measurements and the unique shape of that hook that’s on the original.”
The hanger, which also consists of a custom chain made to match the size and styling of the original, retails for $129 and is limited to 500 pieces. It goes on sale via Regal Robot at noon ET on November 11. At the same time, the company will also release a brand new two-sided Toht bronze bust for $59, showing the owner of the hanger in his final, melted form. You can find more info here.
These releases are perfect examples of what Regal Robot wants to do. The company began several years ago when Spina, who was already running a design company that worked with Lucasfilm, found himself at a unique crossroads. “Regal grew out of work we were doing in the combination of home theming for people, giving people that sort of Disneyland theme park experience in their own space, and creature work and things that we were doing with Lucasfilm,” Spina said. “We had the ideas for what we thought were going to be unique, fun, clever type home decor, and we had the access with Lucasfilm from the work we had been doing with them, and we said, ‘Hey, we could be doing this cool Star Wars kind of officially and create some stuff that isn’t out there right now.'”
In a weird twist of fate, one of the earliest items that fit those parameters gained notoriety here on Gizmodo. Way back in 2008, Gizmodo featured a piece Spina and his team created: a Han Solo in Carbonite desk. The reveal went viral and proved to Spina that there was a market for the things he was thinking about.
“This is the stuff we like to do,” Spina said of the desk. “Take something, turn it on its head, make it into something it’s not, give it some function, make something that’s a little unexpected. It was like, ‘Well, we like this, but is anybody else going to like this?’ And that post by Gizmodo, and the fact that so many other people picked it up, really let us know, like, ‘Oh, yeah, wait, people love this,’ and that to me is the spark of Regal Robot.”
In the years since then, Regal has specialized largely in Lucasfilm items, with some highlights including the Urn of Nurhachi from Temple of Doom, Mandalorian-inspired Mythosaur skulls, and various creature maquettes, masks, and busts from every single nook and cranny of Star Wars. It’s truly an impressive and varied body of work featuring all manner of pieces you haven’t seen anywhere else. And, now, somehow, it’s also made a clothes hanger cool.
So, if you’re a Star Wars or Indiana Jones fan, Regal Robot is just one of those companies you have to keep an eye on because you never know what’s next. “We’re constantly jotting down different ideas for products, either from Star Wars, Indiana Jones, or even other stuff that we’re considering for the future,” Spina said. “We have a very long list of ideas, but honestly, we hardly ever refer to it because we’re all massive nerds for these movies, having digested them so much over the last 40 or 50 years. It’s just part of us.”

31,2025-11-05,"There are some shady mini PCs out there, but you can get a safe and reliable tiny computer from my most trusted brands. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Mini PC are wonderfully compact computers that can pack a lot in a small package. They're also very tempting compared to buying a desktop or laptop since many of them cost significantly less.
That all said, not only can it be daunting to choose from the myriad options to choose from, but there are also some really shady mini PC companies out there that can sell you a device that has malicious software on it. That's why I only recommend people purchase a mini PC from one of the companies that we have tested and trust.
I've put together some tips for buying a mini PC, as well as a list of our most trusted mini PC brands and why we recommend them.
It is certainly possible to factory reset some shady mini PCs, do a clean Windows 11 install, and make them safe to use. However, if you aren't comfortable with that process, it's better to just get a trusted mini PC to begin with. Additionally, you can't always guarantee that all malicious factors have been removed when doing a clean install.
 



These are our most trusted brands listed in alphabetical order. Some brands offer a wide range of PCs while others only offer a few models.
You can head over to our list of the best mini PCs we've tested to see which devices we recommend most.
 



 



 



Some untrustworthy mini PCs come with malicious software or forced browsers installed that are designed to steal your information. You don't want to log in to any of your accounts on one of these mini PCs. You also don't want to connect it to your network, as it can do harm.
RELATED: I discovered malicious software on a couple AceMagic mini PCs a few years ago
Yes, as long as you purchase a mini PC that was made by a trusted manufacturer and sold by a trusted seller, you can get a solid little computer.
If you realize your mini PC is dangerous, you'll want to disconnect it from the internet and remove it from your network. Next, you'll want to wipe and reinstall the operating system.
For help with that, check out our guide on how to do a clean installation of Windows 11.
The majority of shady mini PCs will only have malicious agents on a software level. This means that in many cases, doing a Windows clean install can remove anything dangerous.
However, it is also possible for a company to create something malicious on a hardware level that can't be removed with a clean install, so you shouldn't assume that doing a clean install will automatically make the device safe.
WARNING: It's possible that parts of your mini PC will stop working after a clean install of Windows is done. For instance, when I did a clean install to get rid of malicious software on a mini PC, the Wi-Fi card stopped working. 
After testing them, our most trusted mini PC brands are Geekom, Beelink, ASUS, Lenovo, HP, and Dell. 
Black Friday begins on November 28, 2025, the final Friday of the month, straight after Thanksgiving.
However, retailers aren't waiting for the event to officially commence, as Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and many others are already hosting early Black Friday discounts on many products. 
Hopefully, you found this page helpful. Mini PCs have made my life so much more convenient since they don't take up a lot of room, can cost a lot less than a desktop or laptop. Plus, they can still offer plenty of ports, solid performance, and other conveniences.
You just need to be careful not to fall for the many scams and malicious devices on the market today. If you stick with trusted brands while avoiding generic ones, and don't fall for deals that are too good to be true, you should be able to get an awesome little computer that you can trust.

32,2025-11-05,"Powered by an A18 Pro and featuring a 13-inch display housed in an all aluminum chassis, Apple's rumored cheap MacBook is going to shake up the midrange Windows PC market in a way it previously hasn't been before.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

A new report has provided more information about Apple's rumored upcoming cheap MacBook, and it's not looking good for Microsoft and cheap Windows PCs. According to Bloomberg, Apple is spinning up production on a MacBook that's expected to cost ""well under $1,000"" that will ship in the first half of 2026 and feature Apple Silicon, a 13-inch display, and a premium aluminum chassis.
Murmurs about a cheap MacBook hit the internet earlier this summer, and at the time I called it the nightmare scenario for Microsoft and the mid-range Windows PC market. Up until now, Windows OEMs have gotten away with building uninspired, minimum effort PCs for the $500-700 price category, resulting in usually cheap feeling or poorly performing devices.
A new MacBook for anywhere near $700 is going to sell like hotcakes, potentially impacting the midrange Windows PC market considerably. It's fair to say that most people buying a PC in the $500-$700 price range aren't buying one because they love Windows, and any alternative that's good or better than what's on offer here is going to be preferred by many.
A cheap MacBook, running full macOS and complete with that premium Apple design is going to win out over any plastic or poor efficiency Windows laptop in the same price bracket. Bloomberg says the cheap MacBook will be powered by an A18 Pro SoC, which will give it performance similar to that of an M1 MacBook Air, but with the longest battery life ever achieved in a MacBook. That means it'll easily last over a day on a single charge.
It's also expected to feature a display slightly smaller than the one found in the MacBook Air. If I were a betting man, I'd wager it'll feature a 13-inch display, similar, if not identical, to the one found in the iPad Air. That's no slouch of a display, and while Apple is likely to remove the touchscreen, it'll still be good to look at, and that's all that matters to most people.
Simply put, there isn't a Windows laptop that you can buy new for $600-$700 that will match this MacBook. The closest competitor is Microsoft's Surface Laptop 13-inch, but even that is $899 with a significantly lower-resolution display. The only Windows laptops that even come close to competing are slightly older ones that are on sale, like the ASUS ZenBook A14, which has a 1080P OLED screen and all-day battery life for $699 (or less) on sale.
Ultimately though, given how dire Windows' reputation is these days, I don't think it matters if there are PCs that compete head to head with a cheap MacBook. A lot of people will simply choose a MacBook over a Windows PC simply because the MacBook doesn't run Windows, and more than ever people are scrambling to abandon Microsoft's enshittified OS. 
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
According to online leaks, the upcoming cheap MacBook is expected to launch in the first half of 2026 and cost ""well under $1,000."" It will be powered by an A18 Pro processor, paired with a 13-inch display and premium aluminum chassis. 
Many midrange Windows PCs aren't desirable products. They are built to maximize profit, and as a result are often soulless or even bad deals. You'll find a lot of midrange Windows PCs are built out of cheap plastic, have poor quality displays, or mediocre battery life compared to the more expensive high-end Windows PCs and MacBooks. A cheap MacBook could be more desirable in the $700 price range compared to equivalent Windows PCs as a result.
Currently, Microsoft does not make a PC that would directly compete with a $600-$700 MacBook. The closest Surface PC to compete is the Surface Laptop 13-inch, but that costs $899 new and will have a lower resolution display, albeit with similar performance and efficiency. 
It's up for debate as to whether Windows is better than macOS. These days, many people view Windows 11 to be a bad operating system, no thanks to Microsoft's enshittification of the platform, forcing AI features and advertisements onto users. Many people in the mainstream view macOS to be the better desktop OS, but it ultimately comes down to preference.

The US isn’t exactly the most competitive smartphone market in the world, largely due to a dearth of manufacturers in the country. Nothing is the most recent entrant in the market, but another brand has just announced its own entry.
Fairphone has confirmed to Reuters that it has entered the US market. The company isn’t debuting with its Fairphone smartphones, though, as it’s choosing to launch the Fairbuds XL repairable headphones as its first product in the country. This will be sold in the US as part of a partnership with Amazon.
Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
Fairphone CEO Raymond van Eck reportedly confirmed that the company was also preparing to launch a phone in the market. There’s no word on a release window for the phone, which will presumably be the Fairphone Gen 6.
The company also cited more right-to-repair legislation in various states as a reason to enter the market. The company’s audio and smartphone products all offer repairable designs and easy access to spare parts.
For what it’s worth, Fairphone handsets are currently sold in the US via partner Murena. These particular phones come pre-installed with Murena’s /e/OS Android software, which promises a deGoogled experience. However, Fairphone devices elsewhere come with Google services out of the box. So US consumers would finally be able to get their hands on a Fairphone handset with Google integration.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jad Tarifi, the founder and CEO of the AI startup Integral AI. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment and academic history.
When I graduated from the University of Florida with a Ph.D. in AI in 2012, I didn't see myself starting a company.
My goal, both then and now, is to use AI to positively impact the world. That first led me to Google, where I worked for nearly a decade.
Working at Google was a great experience. Many breakthroughs in the field that we see today, like the transformer, were either invented or developed at Google.
A lot of my management philosophy comes from my experience at Google. At my startup, I try to empower my engineers by leading with compassion and creating a safe environment for them to voice their opinions.
Google is good at generating revenue from advertising and is very much invested in that business model. But if you want to do something different, like build a personal AGI, that might not fit with their advertising model.
It dawned on me that I needed to chart a path to pursue my interest in robotics. A startup would allow me to iterate fast, take risks, and be nimble.
In my final year at Google, I persuaded my manager to send me to Google's Tokyo office. That was in 2020, and I spent a year there before I left to launch Integral AI.
Why Japan? That goes back to my interest and passion for applying AI to robotics.
I spent the bulk of my career in Silicon Valley, and I saw firsthand that the US is a world leader in AI. The US, however, isn't as strong in robotics. That's partly because it has been outsourcing manufacturing to the rest of the world.
Japan, on the other hand, is the world leader in robotics. It makes most of the world's industrial robots. Going to Japan allowed me to combine the best of AI from Silicon Valley with the best of robotics in Tokyo.
Going to Japan gave me access to the country's huge robotics ecosystem. There are so many players in robotics, ranging from suppliers to manufacturers to end customers. You need to understand the ecosystem if you want to serve the market effectively.
I was fortunate to spend my final year at Google in Japan. I used it as an opportunity to immerse myself in the language and culture. To become conversant in Japanese, I placed myself in uncomfortable situations where I had to communicate with locals. Today, I feel comfortable talking to people I meet on the street.
After leaving Google, I founded Integral AI in 2021. My company's goal is to build an AI that can control robots and autonomous vehicles.
Running my business in Japan does come with pros and cons.
One thing that took getting used to was Japan's rigid system of rules and administrative procedures, which can be old-school and inflexible.
For instance, you must use a personal seal, or what the Japanese call a ""hanko,"" to sign documents.
It's not just the way documents are handled. It took me three months to open my company's bank account, despite having a Japanese investor on board. I could have opened a bank account in the US in 30 minutes.
However, I saw these inefficiencies as a small price to pay to access Japan's robotics market and its many players.
Operating in Japan has given me a deep understanding of the ecosystem and how we should design our products to leverage it.
On a broader level, working in Japan showed me the beauty of taking an iterative approach to building products. In the US, the ethos is to move fast and break things. In Japan, you are forced to think small and take a step-by-step approach to solve problems. This systematic approach to working feels healthier and more sustainable.
If you want to accelerate your tech career, Silicon Valley should still be your primary goal, even though the culture there is more individualistic and work-oriented.
But if you want to live and work in a country that values work and community, then Japan may be the place for you. You can get the best of both worlds by working in a Silicon Valley-style tech company in Japan. This is where you can have your cake and eat it too.

Snap saw its stock surge 25% after the market close Wednesday as it announced a partnership with Perplexity to integrate that firm’s AI-powered answer engine directly into Snapchat. Perplexity will pay Snap $400 million over one year, through a combination of cash and equity. Revenue from the partnership is expected to begin contributing in 2026.

	The shares seem to have settled off their early high but up about 15% at $8.45.

	The move gives Snapchat’s community of nearly 1 billion monthly active users a new way to ask questions, explore topics they care about, and learn about the world, the company said. Starting in early 2026, Perplexity will appear in the popular Chat interface for Snapchatters globally. Through this integration, Perplexity’s AI-powered answer engine will let users ask questions and get clear, conversational answers drawn from verifiable sources, all within Snapchat.

	“Our goal is to make AI more personal, social, and fun – woven into the fabric of your friendships, Snaps, and conversations,” said Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. “This partnership reflects our shared vision for the power of AI to enhance discovery and connection on Snapchat, and we look forward to collaborating with more innovative partners in the future.”




			Watch on Deadline		






	“Perplexity’s mission is to support the world’s curiosity,” said Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity CEO. “Millions of people connect and discover the world through Snapchat. By bringing Perplexity to Snapchat, we’re able to serve that curiosity directly where it occurs.”

	Snap said the Perplexity integration marks a first step in Snap’s effort to make Snapchat a platform where leading AI companies can connect with its global community in creative and trusted ways. Snapchatters will still be able to chat with the existing My AI chatbot, with Perplexity joining as an answer engine that helps them find real-time answers from credible sources and explore new topics within the app. Similar to My AI, Snapchatter messages sent to Perplexity will help enhance personalization on Snapchat. Together, Snap and Perplexity aim to make conversational AI an even more seamless part of how people discover and learn on Snapchat.

	










	The AI deal comes as Snapchat added 34 million daily active users in the third quarter to reach 477 million, posted revenue up 10% to $1.51 billion driven by improved advertising demand and ahead of Wall Street forecasts. Net losses narrowed.

	“Our focus on performance, creativity, and simplicity is helping advertisers achieve stronger results while giving our community more ways to communicate,” Spiegel said. “I’m proud of the team’s progress and confident that our discipline and innovation will support durable, long-term growth.”

	Snap anticipated fourth-quarter sales will come in between $1.68 billion and $1.71 billion – the midpoint of $1.695 billion is slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations of $1.69 billion.

Weekly tips on front-end & UX.Trusted by 200,000+ folks.
For years, “UX strategy” felt like a confusing, ambiguous, and overloaded term to me. To me, it was some sort of a roadmap or a “grand vision”, with a few business decisions attached to it. And looking back now, I realize that I was wrong all along.
UX Strategy isn’t a goal; it’s a journey towards that goal. A journey connecting where UX is today with a desired future state of UX. And as such, it guides our actions and decisions, things we do and don’t do. And its goal is very simple: to maximize our chances of success while considering risks, bottlenecks and anything that might endanger the project.
Let’s explore the components of UX strategy, and how it works with product strategy and business strategy to deliver user value and meet business goals.
When we speak about strategy, we often speak about planning and goals — but they are actually quite different. While strategy answers “what” we’re doing and “why”, planning is about “how” and “when” we’ll get it done. And the goal is merely a desired outcome of that entire journey.
A strong strategy requires making conscious, and oftentimes tough, decisions about what we will do — and just as importantly, what we will not do, and why.
UX strategy doesn’t live in isolation. It must inform and support product strategy and be aligned with business strategy. All these terms are often slightly confusing and overloaded, so let’s clear it up.
At the highest level, business strategy is about the distinct choices executives make to set the company apart from its competitors. They shape the company’s positioning, objectives, and (most importantly!) competitive advantage.
Typically, this advantage is achieved in two ways: through lower prices (cost leadership) or through differentiation. The latter part isn’t about being different, but rather being perceived differently by the target audience. And that’s exactly where UX impact steps in.
In short, business strategy is:
Product strategy is how a high-level business direction is translated into a unique positioning of a product. It defines what the product is, who its users are, and how it will contribute to the business’s goals. It’s also how we bring a product to market, drive growth, and achieve product-market fit.
In short, product strategy is:
UX strategy is about shaping and delivering product value through UX. Good UX strategy always stems from UX research and answers to business needs. It established what to focus on, what our high-value actions are, how we’ll measure success, and — quite importantly — what risks we need to mitigate.
Most importantly, it’s not a fixed plan or a set of deliverables; it’s a guide that informs our actions, but also must be prepared to change when things change.
In short, UX strategy is:
The impact of good UX typically lives in differentiation mentioned above. Again, it’s not about how “different” our experience is, but the unique perceived value that users associate with it. And that value is a matter of a clear, frictionless, accessible, fast, and reliable experience wrapped into the product.
I always try to include 6 key components in any strategic UX work so we don’t end up following a wrong assumption that won’t bring any impact:
It’s worth noting that it’s always dangerous to be designing a product with everybody in mind. As Jamie Levy noted, by being very broad too early, we often reduce the impact of our design and messaging. It’s typically better to start with a specific, well-defined user segment and then expand, rather than the other way around.
UX strategy doesn’t have to be a big 40-page long PDF report or a Keynote presentation. A while back, Alin Buda kindly left a comment on one of my LinkedIn posts, giving a great example of what a concise UX strategy could look like:
What I like most about this example is just how concise and clear it is. Getting to this level of clarity takes quite a bit of time, but it creates a very precise overview of what we do, what we don’t do, what we focus on, and how we drive value.
The best path to make a strong case with senior leadership is to frame your UX work as a direct contributor to differentiation. This isn’t just about making things look different; it’s about enhancing the perceived value.
A good strategy ties UX improvements to measurable business outcomes. It doesn’t speak about design patterns, consistency, or neatly organized components. Instead, it speaks the language of product and business strategy: OKRs, costs, revenue, business metrics, and objectives.
Design can succeed without a strategy. In the wise words of Sun Tzu, strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. And tactics without strategy are the noise before defeat.

39,2025-11-05,"The iPhone Air managed to beat the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge to become the slimmest smartphone on the market, though we noted at the time that it’s not the slimmest smartphone we’ve ever seen.
The latest contender on the Android front is the shiny new Motorola Edge 70, which is very slightly thicker than the iPhone Air, but has a much thinner camera bump and compares well in several other ways …
The iPhone Air is the thinnest iPhone ever produced, a record previously held by the iPhone 6 from way back in 2014. At 5.6mm, it’s also slimmer than any of the Android competition on the market – with one proviso – beating the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge’s 5.8mm.
The proviso is that we’re not counting folding phones which are thinner when unfolded. I think that makes sense because what really matters is the thickness of the phone in your pocket. If you do want to count these, however, then the iPhone Air is beaten by no fewer than seven Android folding phones, the slimmest of them at just 4.2mm.
We also noted that three historical smartphones from 2014 and 2016 were slimmer than the Air.
The latest entrant in the ultra-thin smartphone game is the Motorola Edge 70, shown above.
At 5.99mm thick, it doesn’t quite compete with the iPhone Air. However, the camera bump is less prominent, being much more similar to earlier generations of the iPhone Pro models.
The company also hasn’t compromised on camera capabilities to deliver this thin model, retaining three separate cameras at the rear. Additionally, there’s both Face Unlock and an embedded fingerprint reader in the display with just a punch-hole front camera.
Motorola has also somehow managed to squeeze in a 4800mAh battery, which it claims delivers up to 50 hours of use. That’s around double the claimed battery life of the iPhone Air.
Finally, it comes with the company’s own AI chatbot onboard. Motorola claims that this can understand what’s on your screen, but as Engadget notes, we’ll have to see how well it works in real life.
Obviously, nobody embedded into the Apple ecosystem is going to consider this as an alternative to the iPhone Air, but it is interesting to see what can be done, and will hopefully spur Apple on to even greater things should the form factor survive.

There's a report that claims Android phones have a hidden trick up their sleeve that could be faking your true network strength.
This report was put forward by Nick vs Networking, a publication that supposedly discovered Android's network signal fakeout (via Android Authority). Specifically, what the report states is that Google's operating system artificially ""inflates"" the signal (the bars users would see). It cites one key string: KEY_INFLATE_SIGNAL_STRENGTH_BOOL. Within Android, this string is repeated several times for several major cell carriers on the market for consumers.
Android inflates the network signal for Verizon, Tracfone, Xfinity Mobile, AT&T, Bluegrass Cellular, Spectrum Mobile, and several more.
All of a sudden, there's a sharp change in the narrative, and potentially how consumers perceive the words spoken from some of these carriers. The publication continues, stating that Android's code will ""report the signal strength to the user as one bar higher than it really is."" It adds that this ""always"" happens, though it's reportedly unclear who's the one responsible for this artificial inflation tactic.
Another report by FindArticles states consumers can probably work around this, and discover their phone's true cell signal strength. The post highlights the existence of ""About Phone"" and ""SIM Status"" details within your device's Settings app. Users can check there to see what their signal strength is (marked by the dBm measurement). FindArticles states the closer your device's dBm is to zero, the stronger it is, adding that -70dBm is great, while -85dBm is pretty much the baseline before spotty coverage takes place.
 



Further digging shows that, apparently, mobile carriers can turn this artificial inflation trick on themselves, though it is disabled by default. An OTA update is seemingly required before cell carriers can trick users with this one-bar higher ploy.
On a different note, there's already talk of 6G, and it's coming from Verizon. In late September, the cell service announced that it was kickstarting its 6G initiative, as it looked to partner with major brands like Samsung and Nokia. According to Verizon, 6G will ""focus"" on speed, low latency, and AI integration to deliver a better cell service experience to the user.

The company also hopes to have a unified global network for 6G, while also hoping to achieve peak data rates of 1,000Gbps. Samsung adds that 6G will deliver lower latency, which only speeds things up for users looking to connect with the world around them.

Samsung lifted the veil on its much-awaited tri-folding phone, the Galaxy Z Trifold (rumored to be called), earlier last week, and now more information about this device seems to be surfacing. While the images shown off at the APAC Summit in South Korea gave us a view of the trifold from afar, considering no one was allowed to hold the device.
However, a new video has emerged, giving us a closer and more detailed look at the Galaxy Z Trifold (as spotted by 9to5Google). In the video, the presenter goes over the various visible phone specs.
 



Speaking about the display, and according to auto-translated captions, the video states that when folded, the trifold could have a 6.5-inch display like a regular smartphone; however, when unfolded, it will feature a 10-inch display. The video also reveals that the display's bezels appear thick, which could limit usable screen space.
Moving on, while we don't know the exact dimensions of the phone as yet, it is reportedly as sleek as the Galaxy Z Fold 7 when opened up, though it appears notably wide when folded.
Furthermore, we get a good look at the hinges of the device that are placed on both sides of the display, and the presenter also notes that the left one is wider than the right hinge.
You can also see that the camera placement of the trifold is similar to that of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, as the lenses are placed vertically on an elevated camera bump with the flash off to the side. This suggests Samsung could be maintaining a consistent design across its upcoming product line.
The device in question also has its volume rockers and power button on the right side of the phone, with the power button supposedly showcasing a fingerprint scanner.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
While Samsung has kept things under wraps for this part of the globe, rumor has it that the trifold may not even launch in the U.S., considering it might show up with an exorbitant price tag, which, according to Android Central's Senior Editor, Jerry Hildenbrand, is a smart move by Samsung.
It is Samsung's first triple-folding smartphone. It features two hinges and three display sections (panels), allowing it to unfold into a large tablet. This contrasts with the current Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has one hinge and two panels.

I’ve been thinking about the president’s second-term tariff policy for about 8 months now. Even before the April 2nd liberation day, they appeared unlawful to me. I wrote about it a few times; I tracked down Neal Katyal, the attorney who argued the appellate case to be a guest on Masters in Business.
It didn’t seem to me like enough of Wall Street was paying close attention to this.
Today, I listened to the arguments at the Supreme Court (via C/SPAN). I haven’t practiced law in three decades, but you don’t need to be an active attorney to recognize a beatdown when you hear one. Had this been a boxing match, it would have been stopped on a TKO (technical knockout).
I’m going to go out on a limb: All (or nearly all) of the Trump tariffs will be overturned by SCOTUS as unconstitutional. It should be 9-0, but several of the justices have given up any pretense of being neutral, nonpartisan arbiters; my guess is 7-2 or (maybe) 6-3 will affirm the Court of Appeals decision in favor of overturning the tariffs. If you surveyed Constitutional Law professors, I bet it is close to 95% agree tariffs are the province of Congress (as per the Constitution, Article 3, Section 8), and that these Executive orders are unconstitutional.
Considering the plaintiffs have won at both trial (Court of Trade) and at the full en banc hearing in the DC Court of Appeals, this isn’t a big surprise. I suspect any company that paid an unconstitutional tariff will be entitled to a refund. Look at the companies that suffered the largest stock price damage in the first weeks of April; I don’t imagine consumers will be able to easily get a refund.
Perhaps Wall Street has overlooked this, but the market has caught on. It’s very likely (possible?) that a large part of the rally over the past 6 months was the market anticipating this outcome.
Before I get too far ahead of myself, let’s wait for the SCOTUS decision in Trump vs VOS Selections. Hopefully, we see this before the new year…

 Trex Co. (TREX) shares sank to multiyear lows after the maker of deck-building materials posted worse-than-expected results and lowered its outlook, citing a slump in spending for housing projects.

 While the company saw spending in the repair and remodeling sector improving, CEO Bryan Fairbanks said, ""the second half of the season reflected the weaker market conditions that the industry has experienced in the past two years.” Trex expects “this trend to continue in the seasonally slower fourth quarter,” he said. 

 Shares of Trex were recently off some 28%, though they're slightly off earlier lows.

A prolonged housing slowdown continues to weigh on home improvement companies, as Trex Co.'s results show. Demand for big-ticket remodeling projects has cooled in an environment of higher interest rates and tighter household budgets.
 Trex reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.51, missing Visible Alpha forecasts by $0.06. Revenue gained 22.1% to $285.3 million, also short of estimates.

 The company nowsees fourth-quarter sales of $140 million to $150 million, below its earlier estimates, and reported a full-year outlook of $1.15 billion to $1.16 billion. That’s basically the same as 2024, compared to its previous expectation of an increase of 5% to 7%.

 Trex also cut its 2025 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) guidance to 28.0% to 28.5% versus the earlier outlook of more than 31%.

 With Thursday's 28% decline, shares of Trex slumped to their lowest level in more than six years. Read Investopedia's full daily markets roundup here.

46,2025-11-05,"A man at the centre of an organised crime network has been secretly filmed telling BBC undercover reporters how he can help to erase fines of up to £60,000 for employing illegal workers.
The self-described ""accountant"" is among a group of Kurdish men, first exposed in a BBC investigation on Tuesday, who enable migrants to work illegally in mini-marts, by registering the businesses in their own name.
The man, who goes by the name of Shaxawan, told the two journalists that he and his associates could help migrants - including asylum seekers - to set up businesses illegally and ""confuse"" immigration enforcement.
Operating from a solicitor's office in Huddersfield, he said he had ""customers in every city"".
In Companies House listings, Shaxawan is named as Kardos Mateen, a British resident in his 30s, and has been the director of 18 businesses across the north of England.
When later confronted by us, with details of his claims, he denied any wrongdoing.
Trading Standards confirmed it has found illegal cigarettes being sold in many businesses registered under the name Kardos Mateen, and the BBC was sold counterfeit tobacco in four mini-marts where he was listed as the director.
The BBC News two-part investigation has revealed the sophistication and scale of criminal networks profiting from undocumented working on UK High Streets. Loose regulation of Britian's labour market is acting as a pull factor for those entering the UK illegally, the government has acknowledged.
Shaxawan made several claims to our reporters:
Our reporters also spoke to a paralegal, with Shaxawan present, who offered to ""make documents"", including ""business agreements"", to avoid fines.
It took months to set up the first meeting with Shaxawan.
He pulled up at a busy Manchester retail park in a white 4x4 BMW, in the belief he was meeting an asylum seeker who was looking to run a mini-mart and sell illegal cigarettes.
In fact, he was meeting Saman (not his real name), a Kurdish journalist working undercover for the BBC.
In a cafe, Shaxawan freely shared details of what he and his associates were able to offer: ""We are a group. Each of us provides a service and works together,"" he said.
He explained how he worked with an ""English woman who dealt with electricity, gas and bailiffs"". And when Immigration Enforcement issues a fine, he added, ""she makes it zero"".
""I will… set up your company, provide the [card] machine, get you electricity, speak to your landlord,"" Shaxawan assured him. ""I'll make sure you have no issues.""
He told Saman that he should register a mini-mart business in the name of someone else - what is sometimes known as a ""ghost director"". This would cost £400 per month, and getting access to a business bank card would require a one-off payment of £140, he said.
The ghost director would be the one to ""take the risk"" if the shop was raided by law enforcement and fines issued, he explained.
""That's why you're paying,"" he said.
To show he was genuine and to provide reassurance, Shaxawan called someone he said could act as ghost director.
Saman explained to the man on the phone that he did not have asylum status.
""Don't worry"" came the reply. ""As Mr Shaxawan says, send the money at the end of the month.""
ID documents sent to Saman by phone swiftly after his meeting with Shaxawan, revealed that the potential ghost director was a 28-year-old from Iran called Bryar Mohammed Zada.
Mr Zada has racked up company directorships for 20 car washes and mini-marts from Newcastle upon Tyne to Essex in the past 12 months, according to Companies House records.
Undercover journalists found illegal cigarettes being sold at four of Mr Zada's businesses.
Mr Zada did not respond to the BBC's questions.
Saman later called Shaxawan asking for a second meeting, and Shaxawan suggested they meet at RKS Solicitors in Huddersfield.
The firm is registered with the Law Society and has branches in Dewsbury and Sheffield.
The meeting was arranged on the premise Saman needed help to deal with an illegal working fine which had been given to a family member.
There is no mention of the names ""Shaxawan"" or ""Mateen"" on the firm's website.
But Saman had called Shaxawan when he was outside the solicitors, and Shaxawan opened the front door, and welcomed him in.
He led our reporter upstairs to an office, where he outlined how Saman's family member could avoid the fine, transferring company details to someone else for a fee.
RKS Solicitors told the BBC it had no connection to any alleged immigration or fine-related misconduct.
We later got our second undercover reporter, ""Ali"", who is also Kurdish, to investigate further by calling the same RKS Solicitors branch - but without mentioning Shaxawan.
Posing as a Kurdish mini-mart owner, he told the woman who answered the phone that he had received a £60,000 fine from Immigration Enforcement for employing two people without the right to work.
He was given an appointment with Zohaib Hussain, who is listed on RKS's website as a paralegal - someone who can advise on legal matters but is not a qualified solicitor and works under supervision.
As Ali was arriving for his appointment with Mr Hussain at the RKS offices, he came across Shaxawan outside. On the street, Shaxawan repeated the claim he had made to Saman - that he could make fines go to ""zero"" with no comeback from authorities.
Shaxawan again referred to the ""English woman"" he mentioned in the earlier meeting, and said she could make sure that fines for illegal working were reassigned to other people, as if they were the culpable business owner.
Shaxawan said these would be Hungarians who ""live nearby"". They would be paid between £2,000-£3,000 and their names would be used to assume liability for the fines.
He did not give any more details, but an immigration lawyer we spoke to suggested this could work much like receiving a speeding fine, and giving the name of someone else on the paperwork as the person who was driving - and therefore liable to pay the penalty.
Shaxawan said the overall cost to Ali would be about £4,600 per illegal worker. He said he had done this successfully in ""Manchester, Birmingham, Blackpool and Leeds"", with the process usually taking about four weeks.
He added Ali's company would then need to be closed, reopened and re-registered under a new name.
Ali was then let into the RKS branch, and Shaxawan came inside too. Inside an office, Shaxawan showed him documents on his phone detailing the people he claimed to have helped before.
Shaxawan claimed the scam would confuse Immigration Enforcement officers who would not have time to check the details.
Ali was then introduced to the paralegal, Zohaib Hussain. Shaxawan stayed in the room throughout the meeting.
Speaking quickly and in a hushed tone, Mr Hussain fired questions at our reporter about his cover story - the mini-mart and the immigration fine.
""How many illegal workers? So how much is the fine? How many times did they catch you?""
Then, with a chuckle, he asked what was sold in the mini-mart: ""Do you sell vapes? Legal or illegal? Bit of both as well?""
When Ali said his mini-mart was registered under someone else's name, Mr Hussain said: ""Very clever then, already very clever.""
The first step, Mr Hussain said, would be to deal with the fine.
If Ali was not let off the fine, he continued, ""we will look at certain other things that we have to do as precautions"".
""Sometimes we might have to make documents,"" said Mr Hussain, such as ""business agreements"".
Ali then asked if the fine would be transferred to someone else's name. Mr Hussain said that would be ""the last resort.""
Before the meeting ended, Mr Hussain warned that the immigration authorities would want to jump on the fine straight away - making a cutting-motion across his throat.
He said his charges would be £3,500 and he ""would look after us"". He then asked Ali to share any future Immigration Enforcement letters with Shaxawan.
We showed our undercover filming and translations to senior immigration lawyer Bryony Rest, who told us Hussain was ""clearly offering to falsify documents"".
There were ""likely fraud and immigration offences"" taking place, she said, and she would expect law enforcement to investigate.
When we later contacted Mr Hussain for comment he replied by email saying he denied ""all allegations, insinuations, and claims"" we had put to him.
""For clarity, the individual named in your correspondence, Mr Shaxawan Jawad, is not associated with me in any capacity; professional, personal, or otherwise.""
In a statement to the BBC, RKS Solicitors said the company was carrying out an internal review and ""the individual concerned"" had been suspended pending further investigation.
""We are already informing"" the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), it added.
""Mr Hussain is employed as a paralegal under strict supervision… The individual is not authorised or instructed to provide immigration and tax advice.""
The firm did not comment on Shaxawan Jawad. It said it did not condone unlawful conduct and was committed to the ""highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and public service"".
Shaxawan, otherwise known as Kardos Mateen, told us by email that he categorically denied ""every allegation, insinuation and claim made"" in our reporting, and said that he was ""not employed by, associated with, or acting on behalf of RKS Solicitors in any capacity"".
Home secretary Shabana Mahmood, said the Home Office would investigate the BBC's findings. 
""Illegal working and linked organised criminality creates an incentive for people to come here illegally. We will not stand for it,"" she said.

Cinemark saw revenue and profit dip for the three months ended in September on a softer box office, but the nation’s third-largest theater chain will boost its quarterly dividend (by 12.5%) and set a new $300 million share-repurchase program “reflecting the strength of our financial position and continued confidence in our strategic direction and outlook.”

	AMC also said it has eliminated remaining pandemic-related debt through the settlement of $460 million in convertible notes.

	Shares rose 3% in pre-market trading as revenue eased 7% to $857 million, beating forecasts, with admissions at $430 million and concessions at $337 million on attendance of 54.2 million patrons.

	










	Net profit fell to $51 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, from $189 million in the year-earlier quarter.

	The Plano, Texas-based exhibitor said it generated its second-highest quarterly box office ever for non-traditional programming. Revenue from immersive D-Box seating hit a high.

	“We believe Cinemark is well-positioned to continue thriving as we move forward based on our many distinctive advantages, the unparalleled value proposition we offer consumers, the ongoing initiatives we are advancing, and further improvements that are expected in film release volume, scale, and variety,” said CEO Sean Gamble.

	He called the company “enthusiastic about a strong finish to 2025 that is supported by one of the most robust and diverse holiday film slates we have seen in recent history.”

	It’s been glum at the box office with fewer breakouts as the industry struggles to lift grosses from 2024 levels. Marcus Theatres, the No. 4 chain, last week anticipated a major lift from Wicked: For Good opening later this month, noting that presales were trending over three times ahead of last year’s Wicked.

PARIS (AP) — French authorities have warned they may block access to Shein after it emerged that the online fast fashion giant had been selling sex dolls with a childlike appearance.
France’s consumer watchdog, the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control, said last week it had discovered the dolls on Shein’s website, noting that their descriptions and categorization left little doubt as to their child-pornographic nature.
The agency has referred the case to public prosecutors, and Economy Minister Roland Lescure said on Monday he would seek to ban Shein from the French market if such incidents were to occur again.
“This is provided for by law,” he said. “In cases involving terrorism, drug trafficking, or child pornographic materials, the government has the right to request that access to the French market be prohibited,” Lescure told BFM TV.
The law authorizes French authorities to order online platforms to remove clearly illegal content such as child pornography within 24 hours. If they fail to comply, authorities can require internet service providers and search engines to block access and delist the site.
The watchdog said it has issued a formal notice urging the platform to take urgent corrective measures.
Shein said in a statement that it has banned all sex-doll products, and temporarily removed its adult products category for review. It added that it has launched an investigation to determine how these listings bypassed its screening measures.


“The fight against child exploitation is non-negotiable for Shein,” said Executive Chairman Donald Tang said in the statement. “These were marketplace listings from third-party sellers, but I take this personally. Trust is our foundation, and we will not allow anything that violates it.”
He noted that every related product has been removed and that “We are tracing the source and will take swift, decisive action against those responsible.”
Meanwhile, a parliamentary fact-finding mission on the inspection of products imported into France announced it will summon Shein officials for questioning.
“No economic actor can consider themselves above the law. A retailer who sold such an item would have had their store immediately closed by a prefectoral order. Shein must provide an explanation,” said the mission rapporteur, Antoine Vermorel-Marques.

Under French law, the distribution via electronic communication networks of child-pornographic materials is punishable by up to seven years in prison and a 100,000 euro ($115,000) fine.
The watchdog also noted that Shein sells other pornographic products including adultlike sex dolls without effective age-filtering measures to prevent “minors or sensitive audiences from accessing such pornographic content.”
Shein was founded in China in 2012, and the low-cost online retailer is now based in Singapore. Reaching customers mainly through its app, it has enjoyed a meteoric rise to become a global leader in fast fashion, shipping to 150 countries. The company has faced criticism over its labor practices and environmental record.
Lescure’s comments came just days before Shein is due to open its first permanent physical store in Paris, located inside the BHV Marais department store in the heart of the French capital city. The opening has sparked controversy, with an online petition protesting Shein’s arrival gathering more than 100,000 signatures.
Frederic Merlin, president of Societe des Grands Magasins, which owns BHV, called the sale of the dolls on Shein’s platform “indecent” and “unacceptable,” adding that “no product from Shein’s international marketplace” will be sold at the department store.
Meanwhile, the child-protection NGO Mouv’Enfants staged a protest at BHV. “As long as these dolls are available somewhere in the world, the company will remain an accomplice to a system that enables sex crimes against children,” co-founder Arnaud Gallais said.

Masayoshi Son, the chairman and CEO of global tech investment giant SoftBank Group in Japan, suffered a $13.1 billion wealth wipeout on Wednesday – the biggest net worth drop among all billionaires in Asia, according to Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaires List, amid a global selloff triggered by worries over lofty stock market valuations.
The 68-year-old founder, who now has a fortune of $71.5 billion that is mostly based on his stake in SoftBank, is still the richest person in Japan, according to Forbes estimates. SoftBank’s shares plummeted 10% on Wednesday.
“SoftBank is the highest-beta expression of Asia’s AI trade,” says Charu Chanana, Singapore-based chief investment strategist at Saxo, referring to stocks that are highly sensitive to market swings. “The sharp selloff reflects shifting sentiment around high-growth tech names, rather than any company-specific news, and its heavy weighting in the Nikkei is magnifying the market’s drop.”
Investors are concerned that some AI-related companies can’t meet investors’ high growth expectations. The fear was amplified after a raft of U.S.-listed tech firms reported lackluster results overnight. Advanced Micro Devices, an AI chipmaker headed by billionaire Lisa Su, disappointed investors on Wednesday with its revenue forecast for the fourth quarter. Super Micro Computer, whose servers are being used to handle AI-related tasks, missed investors’ expectations.
Risk-averse sentiment spread to SoftBank as markets in Asia opened for trading, with Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index falling 2.5% and South Korea’s KOSPI index down 2.9%. SoftBank, on its part, has come to be viewed as a proxy for investing in OpenAI, as Son directs the firm to fund several of the ChatGPT creator’s financing rounds. The American giant, now valued at $500 billion after employees sold shares to companies including SoftBank and Thrive Capital in October, remains privately held and offers no easy way for the public to invest in it.
“[SoftBank Group] is levered to tech cycle and in particular OpenAI,” says David Gibson, Sydney-based senior analyst at MST Financial.
Gibson says investors have assumed a “lot of upside” to the SoftBank stock. And even with today’s fall, shares are still up almost 150% this year. The Japanese conglomerate has made other AI-related bets, including spending $5.4 billion in October to acquire the robotics unit of Swiss industrial giant ABB. Son envisions fusing robotics with AI technologies to create super intelligent machines. “SoftBank’s next frontier is physical AI,” he said in a statement back then.
Yet investor sentiment may remain downbeat for a while, as markets need time to adjust to the new reality, according to Hironori Akizawa, Singapore-based chief investment officer at Tokio Marine Asset Management International.
“As seen in the early to mid-2024, if no good news for the equity market to hit the new high again, there is a possibility that it will stay at the current level for about three months,” he says. “I don't think the adjustment will take a long time, but it will take time to get rid of the market overheat.”"

The premium headphone market overflows with active noise cancellation options from Sony, Apple, Sennheiser, and countless others, but Bose is still the brand that essentially invented consumer ANC and continues to push the technology forward. The QuietComfort Ultra is the top of the line from Bose and marries its most advanced noise cancellation with class-leading spatial audio capabilities that few competitors can match. Right now, Amazon has dropped the price from $429 down to $329, the all-time low for Bose’s best headphones.
See at Amazon
Bose QuietComfort Ultra has three different listening modes that redefine the way you interact with the world around you: Quiet Mode with full noise cancellation, puts you in a personal bubble of quiet that rejects airplane engines, traffic noise and chatty coworkers. All of this occurs via a series of outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise and inward-facing processing that generates inverse sound waves to nullify noise. Aware Mode turns the tables, piping environmental sound back in through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or oncoming traffic without ever having to take your headphones off. Immersion Mode melds maximum noise cancelation with Bose Immersive Audio-their spatial audio technology that envelops your head with three-dimensional space.
CustomTune technology tailors the sound profile to your ears: When you first don the headphones, they play a brief tone and measure how sound reflects off of your unique ear shape. It then adjusts frequency response to compensate for how your ears naturally emphasize or diminish certain frequencies. Two people listening to the same headphones will hear slightly different tuning optimized for their individual anatomy, ensuring that you get the most accurate sound reproduction possible.
The microphone system stands out for good reason: in practice, it really does deliver clear phone calls. It’s powered by six microphones that collaborate to lock in your voice and filter out background noise, wind and more. You can take calls from a busy street or a windy park and the person on the other end hears you clearly without competing noise.
Comfort is essential when you are wearing headphones for hours on end: The ear cushions employ soft, conforming foam that doesn’t develop pressure points, and the headband evenly distributes weight around your head. Materials feel high-quality with a refined finish; professional enough to use in work settings. The 254-gram weight puts these headphones right in the middle of premium over-ear headphones, light enough to comfortably wear but substantial enough to feel well-built.
With noise cancellation on, you can get up to 24 hours of battery life which means multiple days of use between charges. Toggling on Immersion Mode with spatial audio reduces that to 18 hours, still likely more than enough for a week’s listenings for most people. A 15-minute charge gets you 2.5 hours of playback, which is enough to top off at lunchtime and make it through the afternoon.
For $329, you’ll get tech worth upwards of $400, backed by decades of expertise from Bose itself.

53,2025-11-05,"Can AMD's consumer CPU and GPU markets insulate against a potential AI bubble?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

AMD's third-quarter financial results for 2025 are in, and they're looking good for the NVIDIA and Intel competitor almost entirely across the board. In the age of astronomical AI-related spending, it's great to see Team Red making headway with its consumer graphics card and processor business, and not just AI chips.
Not only did AMD's revenue grow in the third quarter, but it broke a record at $9.2 billion with a gross margin of 52%. That revenue represents a 36% year-over-year increase, which AMD Executive Vice President Jean Hu says ""generated record free cash flow.""
With $1.3 billion in operating income and $2 billion of net revenue, diluted earnings per share work out to $0.75. Looking at the results with a non-GAAP eye — which can often give a better picture of core operations — AMD says its gross margin was 54% and diluted earnings per share were $1.20.
Before these earnings were made public, I probably would have placed my bet on AMD's specialized AI chips — known as Instinct — making the most money for the company. That is, however, not the case at all.
We delivered an outstanding quarter, with record revenue and profitability reflecting broad based demand for our high-performance EPYC and Ryzen processors and Instinct AI accelerators.
AMD says its data center segment's revenue was $4.3 billion, a 22% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024. The company says this growth was, unsurprisingly, driven by its specialized EPYC CPUs and Instinct MI350 GPUs.
It's the client and gaming segment that shows the most growth, and it's not close at all. Third-quarter revenue from this segment was $4 billion, which is an increase of 73% compared to the previous year.
Client revenue alone broke an AMD record at $2.8 billion, an increase of 46% year-over-year. AMD says these record sales were driven by its consumer Ryzen CPUs and ""a richer product mix.""
Considering the almighty AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D — widely considered the best CPU for PC gaming and a nice upgrade over its predecessor, the 7800X3D — and its other new X3D siblings launched at the end of 2024, it's pretty clear that the demand for AMD's coveted CPUs is only climbing.
Ryzen is undoubtedly a hot buy, but it was AMD's Radeon gaming GPUs that grew the most in the third quarter. Gaming revenue hit $1.3 billion in the third quarter, which was a 181% year-over-year increase.
 



AMD's third-quarter 2025 results are impressive, but, of course, it's not always easy to maintain such a performance.
""Our record third quarter performance and strong fourth quarter guidance marks a clear step up in our growth trajectory as our expanding compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center AI business drive significant revenue and earnings growth,"" said Dr. Lisa Su, alluding to some of the deals AI has coming its way in the next few years.
NVIDIA has propelled itself to the top of the world market charts with its specialized AI GPUs, recently blowing past a $5 trillion valuation as the first ever company to do so. AMD undoubtedly wants some of the action.
AMD notes that its AMD AI platform is gaining interest, alluding to the massive OpenAI partnership worth tens of billions of dollars announced in early October 2025. It involves 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct AI GPUs powering OpenAI's next-gen infrastructure; the first gigawatt is set to deploy in the second half of 2026.
Of course, the current tensions between the US and China are getting in the way of Instinct AI GPU sales to one of the largest AI markets in the world, but AMD has priced that into its expectations.
AMD expects that fourth-quarter revenue will be somewhere around $9.6 billion, another increase compared to the third quarter, and that ""does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipments to China.""
Business is indeed taking off for AMD, and it's great to see that it's not just all AI-related revenue. There are serious concerns about a growing AI bubble that wants to wipe out the stock market should it ever burst, but it looks like AMD's more traditional money makers — GPUs and CPUs — would act as great insulators against the storm.
(via PC Gamer)
AMD released quite a few CPUs in 2025, but those that stand out are from the Ryzen 9000X3D series, built specifically for high-performance gaming. Whereas the 9800X3D launched at the end of 2024, AMD followed up with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D in March 2025.
AMD launched mobile versions of its X3D chips, including the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D, in January 2025. The Ryzen Z2 chips for gaming handhelds were also unveiled at CES 2025.
AMD's latest Radeon RX 9000 series of GPUs, including the flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT, launched on March 6, 2025. The RX 9060 XT came later, launching early June 2025. 
AMD also launched the Radeon AI PRO R9700 GPUs for OEMS in July before making them available to everyone in October 2025.
AMD figured out a way to vertically stack a CPU's cache, resulting in quicker transfers of data and more capacity. Together, this design specifically makes a huge difference while gaming. 
With Intel's 2025 desktop chips kind of floundering outside of productivity purposes, AMD's Ryzen X3D hardware has only gained in popularity.

The kids’ electric scooter market is blowing up with super cheap options from unknown brands that skimp on safety certifications and build quality. You see them everywhere online, they tempt you with super low prices but without the testing or engineering that prevents accidents.
Segway Ninebot built a reputation on safe, reliable personal transportationÂ and the eKickScooter C2 Pro brings that same commitment to kids aged 6 to 14. Right now, Amazon has dropped the price from $279 down to $229, hitting an all-time low for a scooter that parents can trust and kids will actually enjoy riding.
See at Amazon
The kick-to-start system avoids the most common cause of kids’ scooter accidents: sudden, unexpected acceleration. The throttle doesn’t kick in until your child gets the scooter up to 3 mph, and removes the possibility of the motor engaging while they are still getting on or adjusting their position. This alone turns the scooter from a potentially very hazardous toy into something kids can safely control from the first ride.
The UL-2272 certification covers the battery system, charging components and electrical circuits, all ensuring that the scooter will not overheat, catch fire, or have electrical failures common in uncertified models. TUV Rheinland’s testing process includes drop tests, water resistance evaluation and sustained load testing that goes far beyond what discount brands bother with.
The scooter features three riding modes that let you match its performance to your child’s skill level and the riding environment. Safe Mode limits speed and acceleration for beginners still learning balance and control. Standard Mode opens up more speed while maintaining manageable acceleration curves. Sport Mode unleashes the full 12.4 mph top speed for experienced riders tackling longer distances or slight inclines. The 150W motor delivers enough torque to handle hills that would stop weaker scooters, supporting up to 132-pound riders.
The adjustable handlebar extends to three different heights to fit kids from elementary school through middle school. After all, a 6-year-old and a 14-year-old have much different heights and arm lengths, and this scooter adjusts to fit both in and out of the box. Proper handlebar height is important for both control and safety-too low, and kids have to hunch over uncomfortably; too high, and steering precision suffers.
On one charge, it provides 9.3 miles of rangeÂ which easily equates to several days of neighborhood rides or trips down to your friend’s house. Charging time is 4 hours, so if your kid plugs it in after getting home from school, then it’s ready to go for the next day’s adventures. Range will vary based on rider weight, terrain, and riding mode, but even conservative real-world use yields 7 to 8 miles, enough for most kids’ typical journeys.
The integrated Bluetooth speaker adds the dimension of entertainment that kids will be seriously appreciative of. Pair the scooter with a smartphone and ride while streaming music, with LED lights pulsating and changing colors in time with the beat. Voice assistant compatibility lets kids control music playback hands-free, keeping both hands on the handlebars where they belong.
At $229, you’re getting a scooter backed by Segway’s engineering expertise and actual safety certifications, not just marketing claims.

You probably don't need us to tell you that many Americans are currently without their normal financial safety net, resulting in an enormous need to stock their pantries at the moment.
Food pantries can be lifelines for those in need, and maintaining a steady flow of donations and food into the food banks is crucial for providing assistance. Cash donations are typically the most effective way to help food banks, as the banks' purchasing power is much greater than that of individuals.
But if you want to help beyond just donating cash, there is a way to do so at no additional cost: by maximizing credit card benefits that you probably aren't using anyway.
Many popular Chase credit cards, such as the World of Hyatt Credit Card (see rates and fees) and the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card (see rates and fees), offer $10 to $20 in monthly Instacart credits in addition to a certain number of months of a free Instacart trial membership (activate by Dec. 31, 2027). A $10 or $20 credit doesn't usually offset a significant portion of a traditional grocery order, so anecdotally, cardholders who don't frequently use the Instacart program often forget to take advantage of these credits.
However, Instacart has what it calls ""Community Carts,"" which it operates in partnership with Feeding America. Through this program, you can place Instacart orders for delivery to food banks across the country.
Each food bank has its own page that lists its most requested items, making shopping relatively easy. Many of these items cost between $1 and $3, so you can order several items using your $10 or $20 Instacart credit. (Or, you can just get one pricier, highly requested item, like a big jar of peanut butter.)
There is a $10 minimum order for Community Carts, and no delivery or service fees apply. So, if you place an order that is approximately the same as your $10 or $20 monthly credit, then your only expenses will be any overage amount plus a tip.
Instacart defaults to a $2 tip on these deliveries (which I think are often batched together since delivery isn't immediate).
You can register multiple eligible Chase cards with Instacart to place a few $10 or $20 orders — one on each eligible card. You'll know it worked when you see the $10 or $20 subtracted from the order screen, as shown above.
By signing up, you will receive newsletters and promotional content and agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy. You may unsubscribe at any time.
To score this grocery delivery benefit, all you need to do is sign up for Instacart and enroll using your eligible Chase cobranded card (through Dec. 31, 2027). Eligible cards include those affiliated with Marriott, Hyatt, Southwest Airlines and IHG.
Below are the Chase cards that offer a $10 monthly statement credit for Instacart purchases:
The information for the Aer Lingus Visa Signature, the Iberia Visa Signature, the Marriott Bonvoy Bountiful and the Southwest Rapid Rewards Premier has been collected independently by The Points Guy. The card details on this page have not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.
Cards that offer a $20 monthly Instacart credit include the Ink Business Cash® Credit Card (see rates and fees) and the Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card. These also offer a free three-month Instacart+ membership (when you activate by Dec. 31, 2027). You can use your Ink card to sign up for Instacart here.
Using your monthly Instacart credit is a simple way to support those who need it right now. While $10 or $20 worth of groceries may not seem like a lot, know that every little bit makes a difference.

64,2025-11-05,"The traveler described the scenario and Reddit and asked fellow users if the behavior was 'next level entitlement'
getty
 A recent plane passenger says he was deemed “rude” and “inconsiderate” by a complete stranger for eating his mid-flight meal before the rest of his row was served.

 A Reddit user described his travel predicament in the r/EntiledPeople forum on Thursday, Oct. 30.

 “On long flights, I preorder a special meal online because I am vegetarian,” the original poster (OP) wrote. “On most flights, the flight attendant brings the special meals first and then starts the normal meal service for the rest.”

Getty
 As the poster expected, these flight attendants began by distributing the special meals out to those passengers who requested them. But to their surprise, they say a complete stranger took issue with their decision to start eating. 

 “A perfect stranger sat next to me and told me that I was rude and inconsiderate because I started eating my vegetarian food before their meal arrived,” the poster wrote. “They said it was [a] basic rule to wait until everyone in the row got their food, and I ruined their flight.”

 “Their face was red and [they] rolled their eyes several times,” they continued. “I stared at them.”

 The poster then asked a fellow Reddit users if the behavior was “next level entitlement,"" adding, “We are not eating together [at] the same table in a restaurant.”

 In the comments, users largely agreed that it was a bizarre scenario. 

 “That’s hilarious,” wrote one reader. “Do they get upset in restaurants when other people are served first? Do they stand up in the middle of the restaurant and announce, ‘Please put your forks down until my food arrives?’ ”

 The person added, “I would have told them that any issues they have can be directed at the flight crew.”

 Another broke down the polite gesture: “That is a common courtesy when sharing a meal with someone. You aren’t having a meal with your seatmate, you’re just sitting next to them.”

 Someone else took a comedic take, asking, “Did you have to go to the bathroom at the same time as them as well?”

 In-flight food can sometimes be a point of contention for passengers, but it can also be a reason for concern.

 On Saturday, Oct. 18, Delta Air Lines flight 2311 from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City was forced to divert because a passenger brought spoiled food on board, according to ABC 4 and KSL. 

 A Delta spokesperson told PEOPLE, “As nothing is more important than the safety of our customers and people, our crew followed standard procedures to safely return to Los Angeles after an unpleasant odor was detected onboard.” 

 The spokesperson apologized to customers for “the delay in their travels” and confirmed the food was not related to any in-flight food or drinks provided by Delta.

Elon Musk wants to be anointed the world’s first trillionaire—but he swears it’s not about the money.
Over the past few weeks, the Tesla CEO has been demanding greater power over the electric-vehicle manufacturer that he has led for almost two decades. Specifically, he is asking for another 12 percent of the company—a stake currently worth roughly $190 billion. If shareholders vote for it, and if Musk meets the board’s goals for drastically increasing the company’s value, the total value of his personal stake will shoot up to $1 trillion. At Tesla’s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders will finish voting on whether to give him both more money and more control over the company’s governance—or to give him neither.
The compensation package is partly a reflection of Tesla’s changing priorities. The company’s “Master Plan IV,” released in September, “makes no mention of any new electric cars in the works,” Patrick George recently wrote in The Atlantic. “It is instead a technocratic fever dream, predicting a future in which humanoid robots made by Tesla free us from mundane tasks and create a utopia of ‘sustainable abundance.’” Tesla’s board has said that the compensation package will help motivate Musk to pursue these innovations; in the company’s third-quarter earnings call last month, robots—not money—were at the heart of Musk’s argument for more shares. “If I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future?” he asked.
As the world’s richest man and the CEO of several companies, Musk exerts an enormous amount of influence over many people’s lives, but Tesla’s structure does include some checks on that power. Tesla is, on paper, overseen by those who actually own the company—which isn’t always the case at other public companies. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, owns about 13 percent of Meta, but as of last year, he controls 61 percent of the total voting power, thanks to a special class of stock that grants him outsize sway over corporate governance. This system is not a democratic representation of all shareholders’ views, but it is nevertheless popular among today’s tech companies. Snap Inc. (the parent company of Snapchat) is perhaps the most extreme example; its two co-founders control more than 99 percent of the vote.
The fact that a vote against Tesla’s pay package is even technically possible is a reflection of a not-so-monopolized voting structure. Companies often have valid reasons for deciding to centralize so much control in the hands of a few individuals (dissenters can make it hard for boardrooms to move quickly on decisions, and outside interests can dilute a founder’s vision, to name two). But that centralization can also lead to something of a shareholder monarchy. Although Tesla is already consolidated around Musk, he still doesn’t own a majority of the company. If shareholders were to reject his pay package, they’d be reminding the board that, for now, they still have ultimate say over how the company is run.
Analysts generally believe that the compensation package will be accepted, because top Tesla shareholders have been content to follow Musk’s lead in the past. The company’s structure should ideally enable a multiplicity of dissenting voices—but more often, shareholders are simply willing to go with the board’s recommendations. This time, however, there has been early and forceful pushback. Some shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, the bank behind the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, have come out against the plan on the grounds that $1 trillion is simply too much money for a single CEO. Prominent public figures have weighed in too: “We’re in big trouble,” Pope Leo XIV said of Musk’s possibly becoming a trillionaire.
But in the world of corporate governance, there are forces far more influential than the pope. Among them are the proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, which do market research and advise fund providers such as BlackRock and Vanguard on how to vote their shares. The people invested in BlackRock’s and Vanguard’s funds aren’t all corporate bigwigs; some of them are ordinary people, with pensions and IRA accounts. Most of them won’t vote at Tesla’s shareholder meeting, but BlackRock and Vanguard certainly will. ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended voting against Musk’s pay package, as they’ve done repeatedly in recent years—Musk responded by calling the companies “corporate terrorists” during last month’s earnings call—although what BlackRock and Vanguard will decide is still unclear.
Tesla leadership has been mounting a steady campaign to undermine any dissent; a slick website, VoteTesla.com, lays out why voters should approve the pay package. But now the board appears to be scrambling. The chair, Robyn Denholm, who usually eschews public appearances, has been on something of a media tour over the past few weeks, defending the plan. For the board, this vote is existential. As early as last year, Musk was heavily implying that he would leave the company if he couldn’t have that 25 percent stake. If he exits, Tesla’s stock will almost certainly tank.
Tesla’s board of nine, which includes Musk’s brother, seems to trust him completely. (After rejecting a previously proposed pay package, a Delaware court said that certain board members were not independent, citing concerns about undisclosed “connections between the members of the Compensation Committee and Musk”; Tesla is appealing the decision.) Whether shareholders outside Musk’s inner circle still maintain that trust is a question that will be answered later this week. Musk said in the earnings call that he wants just enough voting control to retain a “strong influence.” The conflict over his pay package is a reminder that influence shouldn’t be taken for granted.

There Was One Dick Cheney All Along
By David Frum
In Vice President Dick Cheney’s later years, former detractors sometimes expressed puzzlement about his political trajectory. The onetime designated villain of the Iraq War had somehow mutated into a hero of the anti-Trump constitutional resistance. Had he changed? Or had they misjudged him?
People do change. Perspectives can shift. But oftentimes the secret to later-life decisions is encoded in early experiences.

71,2025-11-05,"Some YouTube TV users have found a credit in their account for $60 off their subscription, but it's not related to the platform's ongoing contract dispute with Disney.
Disney's content was pulled from YouTube TV on Oct. 30 after the companies could not reach a new contractual agreement. YouTube TV said it would offer subscribers a $20 credit if the Disney channels remain unavailable for an ""extended period of time,"" which has not yet been specified.
In the days since, some YouTube TV subscribers looking for more information on the new credit may have come across an offer in their account for money off their monthly subscription. However, YouTube TV spokesperson Jess Gibby confirmed to USA TODAY that the credits ""are not related to the Disney dispute.""
""These are for subscribers who previously cancelled or paused their subscriptions. The $20 credit has not yet been issued,"" Gibby said.
YouTube TV's base plan goes for $82.99 per month. Premium add-ons increase the monthly rate.
Some YouTube TV users have noticed an offer for a credit off their subscription − a deal that equates to $10 a month over six months, or $60 in total.
The credit isn't available for all YouTube TV subscribers, and for those who are eligible, it isn't automatically applied.
Here's how to find it, according to a USA TODAY review:
The offer only shows up for subscribers who have previously canceled or paused their subscriptions, which is why not all users will see it in their account.
Although YouTube TV said it would offer subscribers a $20 credit if the Disney channels remain unavailable for an ""extended period of time,"" it hasn't yet issued the discount, Gibby said.
As for when it will offer the credit, YouTube TV previously told USA TODAY it will alert subscribers when it is available.
YouTube TV and Disney have still not come to an agreement to make the latter's channels, like ESPN and ABC, available on the live television streamer.
YouTube TV accused Disney of proposing ""costly economic terms that would raise prices on YouTube TV customers and give our customers fewer choices.""
On the other side, Disney has said Google, YouTube TV's parent company, ""is using its market dominance to eliminate competition and undercut the industry-standard terms we’ve successfully negotiated with every other distributor.""
Google also rejected Disney's plea for ABC to be restored on YouTube TV on Tuesday, Nov. 4, which was Election Day in some parts of the country.

Pizza Hut, one of America's most recognizable pizza chains, is facing an identity crisis.
Yum! Brands, Pizza Hut's parent company, said on Tuesday that it is exploring a potential sale of the red-roofed icon. The announcement came as the company reported that Pizza Hut's same-store sales fell 1% during the third quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of declines.
I visited two Southern California locations to see why Pizza Hut is falling behind and found a restaurant caught between its nostalgic past and an uncertain future. Although Pizza Hut's food is still solid, it appears to be struggling to prove its value to consumers in today's crowded dining scene.
""The Pizza Hut team has been working hard to address business and category challenges; however, Pizza Hut's performance indicates the need to take additional action to help the brand realize its full value, which may be better executed outside of Yum! Brands,"" Chris Turner, chief executive of Yum! Brands, said in a Tuesday statement.
He said on the company's earnings call that day that it's reviewing strategic options, which could include a sale of the Pizza Hut business. Yum! Brands has retained Goldman Sachs and Barclays as financial advisors to review potential deals.
A representative for Yum! Brands declined to comment beyond the company's public statements.
Founded in 1958, Pizza Hut rose to prominence with its sit-down style family restaurants, which featured its once-famous salad bar. However, it began scaling back its large-scale formats in the early 2000s and now primarily operates take-out-only stores.
Stepping into the first location, about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, I was greeted by the familiar scent of baking crust and melty cheese — but no menu board in sight. Instead, a small cardboard pop-up near the register displayed several ads for meal deal specials and a QR code I could scan to see the full menu.
The omission of a full menu display suggested the company has become more dependent on deliveries and online orders than in-person visits to the counter.
I opted for a personal pepperoni pizza, once a staple of my childhood, thanks to Pizza Hut's ""Book It!"" program. To this day, the program offers school-aged kids free pizza when they submit proof that they've reached their monthly reading goals. As an adult with no completed reading log, however, the four-slice miniature pizza cost $9.70.
The pizza was exactly as expected: crispy on the bottom, with a hint of sweet marinara sauce, melted mozzarella cheese, and two pepperonis per slice, but I was struck by the price point for such a small meal.
Pizza prices have increased by more than 15% over the last five years, while more operators are offering pizzas and flatbreads on their menus, Restaurant Business Online reported in October, citing Technomic data. Once considered a value option, 35% of consumers now choose to order pizza less frequently due to increased costs, the outlet reported.
That means stiffer competition for Pizza Hut, which has to compete with more chains, from Domino's to Little Caesars, for fewer potential customers.
Business Insider reported in August that, as consumers tighten their belts and eat out less, they're becoming increasingly loyal to their favorite brands and seeking out coupon deals when they do choose to dine out.
At the second location, I noticed a prominent ad for a value-focused offering: Pizza Hut's new ""Flatzz"" menu items. These thin-crust flatbreads are priced at just $5.46 after tax when they're ordered before 5 p.m.
The ""Flatzz"" pizza seemed to be a better deal. It offered eight slices of pizza with more flavor than the personal pizza at the first store. The flatbread option was a good value, and I wouldn't have known it existed had it not been for the sign near the door.
Both restaurants were clean, the staff inside were friendly, and Pizza Hut still has the ingredients that made it a household name — the gooey cheese, familiar logo, and comforting nostalgia.
However, in the current dining landscape, familiar pizza is no longer enough to guarantee a seat at the table. Pizza Hut's next challenge is to convince customers that it still offers value in a market where ""fast"" and ""cheap"" have become the default ingredients for success.

73,2025-11-05,"I've never owned a Nerf gun in my life, but the few times I've heard about them, it's never been to discuss the stock options. From the very small amount of discourse I've seen, Nerf owners like nothing more than to take apart their foam dart guns and perform all kinds of wild modifications that turn them into miniature weapons of mass destruction. It's like a black market arms race to see who can make their child-safe toy the most dangerous tool on the planet.
Well, it turns out that people do more than just make it shoot farther, harder, and faster. Sometimes, people just flat out strap a sci-fi-esque ammo counter to the top of their gun to make it look like something you'd find on a tinkerer's desk in a cyberpunk dystopia, and now I'm wondering if airsoft isn't as dangerous as I first thought it was.
In a post on the Raspberry Pi subreddit, user Bito_Tech showed off their newest Nerf-based project. It's a small screen that sits atop their Nerf shotgun, powered by a Raspberry Pi that detects how many shells they have left. It's still a work in progress, so wires are going everywhere and there's a free-moving battery that dangles off the side like a decorative charm, but if I'm being honest, I think that the messiness really sells the ""scrap-built gun made in the distant future"" look.
Here's what Bito_Tech has to say about this cool project: 
Running this off a Pi Pico 2 using CircuitPython. This ammo counter was built from the ground up. I learned how to make PCB’s just for this project and even got a custom one manufactured for it. Now I need to make an enclosure for all of the components.
At the time of writing, Bito_Tech says that they'll post more ""videos and information"" soon. However, we did get a sneak peek into how they made this device when someone in the thread asked if the device assumes a full magazine every time one's loaded in:
It doesn’t assume. Instead when you load a new shell inside, there’s a small button on the bottom to update the display that there’s a new shell loaded (shown in video). Then when you chamber a round, the rectangle on the right indicates that there is a round chambered in the gun (also shown in video). The max mag size for this gun is 4 shells (not shown in this video) and you can actually adjust that within the settings with different magazine extensions for the gun (also not shown in this video).
Very awesome stuff. While we wait for more information, check out this incredible DIY firing range powered by an ESP32.

79,2025-11-05,"Good morning! It's Wednesday, November 5, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift, your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around.
In this morning's edition, a cavalcade of automakers are telling the White House to extend the current North American free trade deal, Toyota finds a silver lining in rising US sales as tariffs impact year-on-year profits, Rivian also outperformed third quarter projections and BYD surpassed Tesla's sales in the United Kingdom.
Nearly every mass-market automaker with a significant stake in the American market filed comments with the US Trade Representative's Office ahead of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement's formal review. Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mazda, Rivian, Stellantis, Tesla, Toyota and Volkswagen let them positions be known as the industry hopes for some semblance of stability from the Trump administration. From Reuters:
Hyundai said in a filing that uncertainty about USMCA was delaying investment decisions.
""Early confirmation of USMCA's extension would immediately unlock over $20 billion in new American investments,"" the automaker told the USTR. ""Every month of ambiguity slows job creation, site selection and technology development.""
Honda also urged the Trump administration ""to expedite the USMCA review process and take immediate steps to normalize North American trade."" The Japanese automaker added ""with Chinese firms increasingly seeking to route production through Mexico or Canada to avoid U.S. tariffs, a united front is far more effective to combat transshipment from China.""
Tesla said ""to continue this forward momentum and strengthen U.S. competitiveness, the United States should support the continuation of USMCA as a trilateral agreement.""
The impact of this formal review will endure far beyond President Trump's second term in office. If all three countries party to the deal agree to extend, the USMCA will remain in place for 16 years.
Believe it or not, the tariffs imposed by President Trump are having a significant impact on Toyota's bottom line. The Japanese automaker's US sales grew by nearly 6% despite the tariffs provoking a 7% drop in year-on-year profit. There is still demand for Toyota vehicles, but they are just more expensive to produce because the President effectively picked a number out of a hat to tax imports. From the Associated Press:
Toyota said its efforts, such as bigger sales, better model mix and cost cuts, will add more than 900 billion yen ($5.8 billion) to the company's bottom line in this fiscal year.
""Despite the impact of U.S. tariffs, we have continued to build upon our improvement efforts such as increasing sales volume, improving costs and expanding value chain profits,"" it said in a statement.
During the six months through September, it sold more than 1.5 million vehicles in North America and 970,000 vehicles in Japan.
First half sales grew 5.8% to 24.6 trillion yen ($160 billion). For the latest quarter through September, Toyota reported a 62% rise in profit to 932 billion yen ($6 billion) on 12.38 trillion yen ($80 billion ) in sales, up 8% on year.
Toyota is weathering the economic storm and taking steps to maintain its growth. However, the US market is important enough to the Japanese manufacturer that its profit is directly impacted by the policies coming out of the Oval Office.
Rivian is burning cash at a prodigious rate and reported a $1.2 billion loss for this year's third quarter, slightly worse than last year's $1.1 billion Q3 loss. Although the figures aren't comforting, they were better than expected. The electric automaker saw a 32% percent increase in deliveries as customers rushed to take advantage of the EV tax credit before it expired. From Automotive News:
On the company's earnings call, CEO RJ Scaringe said the surge in EV sales last quarter caused an expected ""softer demand environment"" in October across the industry.
But Rivian, he said, is looking at the longer-term horizon for EV demand and expects the company will have a winner with its R2 midsize crossover next year.
""Ultimately, customers are going to be making decisions around what's the best product for them,"" Scaringe said. ""We need to build the best vehicles and give customers great choices.""
Scaringe said in response to an analyst question that Rivian has no plans to build hybrid vehicles to bolster demand. The R2, smaller than the current R1S crossover, will be competitive as a fully electric vehicle compared with hybrid or gasoline rivals, he said.
Rivian's hesitancy to hit hybrid relief value may prove prudent if the R2 lives up to the hype provoked by its reveal. Opting to produce hybrid vehicles would begin as a band-aid, but then evolve into a production line it can't afford to shut down.
BYD is quickly establishing a dominant position in the global electric vehicle market. The Chinese automaker surpassed Tesla in British sales for the first time last month. While Tesla's decline can be measured by just a few percentage points, BYD's sales have skyrocketed compared to its figures from last year. From Bloomberg:
The Chinese manufacturer registered almost seven times more new cars than its American counterpart last month, the UK's automotive trade group said Wednesday. On a year-to-date basis, BYD's sales have soared more than sixfold to 39,103, while Tesla's have slipped 4.5% to 35,455.
BYD's rise has been meteoric — it registered only 8,788 cars last year, when the UK overtook Germany as Europe's top market for fully electric vehicles. Tesla outsold the company by an almost 6-to-1 margin.
Tesla's struggles to maintain sales in Europe have been an ongoing challenge with its aging model lineup and Elon Musk's widespread unpopularity. BYD could claim that it's the biggest electric automaker in Europe with some legitimacy, but it can now definitely state that the UK is its largest market outside of China.
While many incorrectly believe that Henry Ford invented the automobile, he never claimed the accolade. George Selden, on the other hand, did–at least, here in the U.S. The Western New York native claim that he invented the car and applied for a patent in 1879. His patent application for ""a liquid-hydrocarbon engine of the compression type"" was approved on November 5, 1895. Read more about Selden's patent and Ford's court efforts to fight it at the National Museum of American History.
With Zohran Mamdani's historic victory in New York City's mayoral election last night, Eric Adams' days in office are numbered. While we fondly remember him comparing the city's trash containerization efforts to landing a man on the Moon, let's play his anthem one last time."

Bitcoin prices slipped below $100,000 for the first time since June this week, capping a string of declines that dragged the world's largest crypto into a bear market. 
After a big shakeout in any market, it's natural to think: what's next? 
Prices regained some momentum on Wednesday, slowly inching into the green after Tuesday's big rout. Luckily, despite the turbulence, most crypto pros aren't worried that bitcoin could be headed for a prolonged bear market. 
Vitaliy Shtyrkin, CPO at crypto payment firm B2BINPAY, says the crypto market broadly has entered a corrective phase, but conditions are not overtly bearish.
""In our view, the $100,000 level is the most important support for Bitcoin,"" he said. ""We see a higher probability of consolidation rather than a deeper correction toward the mid-$80,000s, and a smaller bullish impulse if macro easing and ETF inflows resume.""
Ray Youssef, co-founder and CEO of decentralized P2P network Paxful, acknowledged that the market is in an exhaustion phase in which positive news has little impact on crypto prices, but bad news immediately sends them down.
However, he also sees signs of a recovery, at least in the short term.
""The market is already gradually approaching a potential capitulation point, which historically has often been a harbinger of new growth. Mass liquidations of long positions often signal capitulation and a possible local bottom. After such events, the market often experiences a brief rebound,"" he stated.
He added that this is especially true if crypto liquidation volumes reach extreme levels, as they have recently. 
With nothing akin to the AI narrative that's buoyed stocks, crypto investors have largely been pinning their hopes on continued monetary easing by the Federal Reserve. But that was thrown into doubt last week as Jerome Powell indicated more rate cuts are not a sure thing given the state of the economy and a lack of economic data. 
The brisk selling this week was partly a result of the fear that the market could be devoid of positive catalysts for some time. 
Crypto analyst Nic Puckrin isn't surprised by that fear among traders. He noted that when prices dip below a key psychological threshold, such as $100,000, it tends to fill investors with dread, although he doesn't see a reason to panic just yet. 
""It's worth remembering that despite the recent sell-off, bitcoin is currently only around 20% below its all-time high. This is crypto, not the bond market, so a 20% drop is often just a buying opportunity.""
Puckrin thinks that bitcoin prices can reach $150,000 during this cycle.
Guillermo Fernandes, founder of blockchain compliance startup Blockpliance, evoked a classic Wall Street adage to illustrate his take on a potential recovery: the market takes the stairs up and the elevator down.
While Fernandes thinks a bitcoin recovery is inevitable, he doesn't expect it to be quick. 
""After October's elevator-drop crash, the climb will be slower,"" he told Business Insider. ""Intrinsic volatility has fallen to approximately 45% as Wall Street money and institutional capital dominate large buyers, turning parabolic pumps into progressive ones. With Q4 seasonality, Fed QT taper, and a $100K—$110K liquidity floor, expect a higher than today price by year-end.""
Carlos Guzman, a researcher at crypto market maker GSR, is more measured in his near-term take.
""I think there's likely to be some more pain in crypto markets in the short term,"" he stated. ""There's lingering weakness from the October 10 crash, and the market is still digesting the consequences.""
Guzman was referring to last month's liquidation event, which was the worst ever for bitcoin. He added, though, that as crypto adoption accelerates and monetary policy shifts in a direction that favors risk assets, his overall market outlook for the next six to 12 months is increasingly positive.

They started as quirky, niche figurines cherished by designer-toy fans, but Labubu dolls have surged into the mainstream to become 2025’s must-have plush. Both kids and adults are scrambling to snag an original, fueling midnight bidding wars, black-market trades, and even investigations into potential fakes.

First launched by the Chinese toy company Pop Mart in 2019, following the creation of Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, these fuzzy vinyl plushes have become highly sought after and valuable. Some now fetch thousands, and one thing trumps everything else: authenticity.
Hardcore collectors are hiring forensic toy analysts, tracking blockchain certificates, and even traveling overseas to authenticate genuine items. Originals routinely sell out within minutes on Pop Mart’s site and other retailers, turning collecting into a high-stakes game.
In a world where rarity and reputation are everything, the pursuit of an authentic Labubu has evolved from a hobby to an obsession. They’re not for everyone, but for superfans, owning one is worth just about any cost.

Labubus have existed for years, but only recently have they gone global. Their meteoric rise is largely thanks to Pop Mart’s limited-edition drops earlier this year. These gremlins and monster-like figures, inspired by Nordic mythology, sparked frenzy in June when fans camped overnight outside Singapore’s Ion Orchard mall, with lines wrapping around the block.
The craze swept across Asia, where some South Korean stores were forced to close after being mobbed by shoppers.

The fever spread westward, too. In the UK, brawls broke out in May after Labubu dolls were yanked from shelves. In the US, demand continues to surge, amplified by blind-box releases and constant teases of upcoming variants.
Several celebrities, including Kim Kardashian, Dua Lipa, and Rihanna, have been seen with Labubus clipped to their bags. But no star has fueled the obsession more than Lisa from Blackpink.
She’s promoted the plushes on social media, earning the fan-dubbed title of “Labubu Queen.” Interest has skyrocketed as a result.
The financial draw is huge. Once priced under $20, some Pop Mart dolls now fetch as much as cars or artworks. One four-foot mint-green Labubu sold for over $150,000 at the Yongle International Auction in Beijing. These headlines are prompting collectors to drive first-edition prices even higher.

While China remains the epicenter, Labubus are now a worldwide phenomenon. After releasing mini versions in August, Pop Mart reported a 1,200% revenue increase in the US and a 700% increase in the UK (via the BBC).
Blind boxes and keychains were only the start, and fans are now chasing rare editions with surgical precision.
Some collectors are going to extremes. Reports of scuffles at vending machines and chaotic store stampedes are standard.
One Shanghai influencer even posted footage of a child smashing a chandelier during a meltdown at Labubu.
What began as an underground art toy has evolved into a global phenomenon. Prices are soaring, knockoffs are rampant, and collectors are increasingly obsessed with separating the real from the fake.
As the Labubu frenzy peaked in 2025, a shadowy underworld of counterfeits, shady resellers, and high-stakes scams emerged alongside it. Both die-hard collectors and casual fans are vulnerable to being scammed by Lafufus, the name given to these increasingly sophisticated fakes.
Fake Labubus have flooded the market, riding the wave of global hype and limited availability. In the UK alone, knockoff figures accounted for 90% of all counterfeit toys seized at the border in 2025, with The Guardian revealing that many had skipped every legally required safety check.
Beyond copying original models, these faux dolls pose serious risks. Illegal warehouses have been raided worldwide, including one in Shanghai that held 5,000 Lafufus valued at $1.7 million. Online sellers are also pushing fake “custom edition” versions or price-gouging legitimate ones to exploit demand.
Financial loss is the most significant danger when buying fakes. Scammers target desperate collectors with low-quality dupes on resale platforms like eBay. TikTok is full of videos exposing counterfeit unboxing videos like this one, where a woman unknowingly paid $300 for a fake.

Legal enforcement efforts are ramping up worldwide. Warnings have been issued in both the US and UK over choking hazards tied to Lafufus, which often have loose components and subpar construction. Trading Standards officials in London recently seized 100 counterfeit items from two physical shops, demonstrating that the problem extends beyond the internet.
The most challenging part is that many fakes look nearly identical to real Labubus. As scammers grow bolder, spotting them has become a serious challenge. The best defense is knowing precisely what authentic Labubus look like.
With counterfeits flooding the market, Pop Mart’s official Labubus have unique features that help verify authenticity, such as box design, tags, and attachment rings.

Fake packaging often mimics the real thing, but usually slips up. Many lack licenses or have the wrong artist name. Genuine boxes feature a matte finish, crisp branding, and a holographic QR code that links back to the official Pop Mart site.
The signature ugly-cute look of Labubus is another giveaway. For instance, authentic dolls have exactly nine teeth, whereas knockoffs often overlook this detail. Limited editions, such as the 2023 Macaron Labubu or Big Into Energy series, also have specific traits, like skin tone or finish texture, that fans should be aware of before shopping outside official stores.

Even small things matter. Real Labubus have clear wash labels, foot logos, and artist signatures. Scammers tend to skip these finer details. Blurry prints, missing logos, or color mismatches are all red flags when spotting fakes.
Original versions of popular toys have always fetched big prices. Squishmallows and Beanie Babies had their moments, but nothing compares to the global Labubu craze. Collectors are willing to pay a premium for originals thanks to their rarity, craftsmanship, and the broader boom in designer-toy culture.

Labubu’s skyrocketing value is primarily driven by scarcity. Limited drops are released in small batches, and region-specific variants often sell out quickly online. Every collector wants something no one else has. Pop Mart leans into this, focusing on quality and rich visual storytelling that resonates on a personal level.
In 2025, owning a Labubu has become a symbol of status. They show cultural awareness and crossover appeal. Labubu-branded bags, charms, books, and even a TV show are helping bridge generations.
Looking ahead, Labubus shows no signs of slowing down.
Most Labubu blind boxes cost between $28 and $30. However, rare or special-edition models can fetch hundreds. Keychains and clip-ons tend to be more affordable.
Labubu dolls were first introduced in 2015 as part of a Hong Kong toy series called “The Monsters,” created by artist Kasing Lung. Pop Mart began producing them in 2019.
Not every Labubu holds high value, but first-edition and limited models can sell for thousands of dollars. Some have even appeared in high-profile collector auctions.

PlayStationPS5Sony 
“Itâs important to realize that weâre really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that weâre taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that.” That’s how PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst described Sony’s approach to porting its first-party exclusives to PC earlier this year. But recently discovered references to PC gaming and a possible “cross-buy” feature on the PlayStation 5 storefront have some wondering if the company’s about to do something more bold when its PS6 console lineup arrives in the not-too-distant future.
According to dataminer Amethxst (and corroborated by others), new symbols have recently been added to the PlayStation Store backend for PS5. One is a shared “PS5/PC” icon and the other reads “Cross-Buy.” They add that the new symbols use official Sony fonts and aren’t found on PS4. While these new icons aren’t yet proof of anything, they suggest Sony is exploring new features that would expand the PlayStation ecosystem beyond a single console, much like Microsoft has been doing with its “Play Anywhere” initiative and recent movement into PC gaming handhelds with the full-screen Windows gaming experience for the ROG Xbox Ally X.
I didn't think this and @Zuby_Tech's post would go viral, so:– The screen is real (see video below)– The symbols are present on PS5 (not PS4)– The symbols are official Sony 'fonts' (uf-code: EF5B to EF61)

One thing we do know is that Sony has been exploring how to expand its reach into PC gaming for years by bringing its biggest blockbusters to Steam and the Epic Games Store. That effort began with Horizon Zero Dawn in 2021 and has seen major PS5 exclusives like Spider-Man 2 arrive on PC in as little as 15 months after the console version released. At that pace, Astro Bot should arrive by early next year. But Sony has stopped short of going full day-and-date on PC with its releases, outside of online multiplayer games like Helldivers 2.
It’s also struggled to navigate how to bring those games to another platform while still getting new players to join its existing PlayStation Network service. Sony has added trophy support and other features to Steam versions of games like Ghost of Tsushima but has also faced backlash over PSN login requirements for even its single-player blockbusters. It’s a tricky tightrope to walk that comes with obvious downsides for Sony, the most significant of which is that other companies get a cut of the sales when PlayStation games are sold on PC.
One obvious solution to that problem would be a full-blown PlayStation PC launcher like Ubisoft and other third-party publishers have. Indeed, Sony was reportedly exploring exactly thatÂ based on references found in the files for Spider-Man Remastered. While the company eventually opted to integrate PSN directly into the Steam versions of games, the newly discovered references to “PS5/PC” and “Cross-Buy” make it seem like a bespoke PlayStation PC launcher might still be on the table.
A PC launcher seems like the most obvious way that Sony could allow players to purchase a game like God of War on console and then redeem the PC version of it at no extra cost, or vice versa. Microsoft’s “Play Anywhere” initiative works similarly. Buying Baldur’s Gate 3Â on Xbox Series X doesn’t qualify you for the Steam version of the game but it does get you access to the Windows version, because Microsoft owns that storefront and has worked out the licensing agreements with third-party publishers.
But this isn’t the first time Sony has supported “Cross-Buy” in the PlayStation ecosystem, and these new references could also be hinting at potential plans for the company’s rumored handheld. A big selling point of the PlayStation Vita back in the day was that some games only had to be purchased once to play them across both the portable and PS3. One of those was the original Helldivers. It was a neat idea that abruptly ended thanks to the Vita’s quick demise.
A new high-end gaming handheld that approaches the power of a PlayStation 5, however, would bring “Cross-Buy” back in a big way. There are two interesting possibilities here. The first and most expected is that Sony’s rumored next-gen handheld would have access to all of the games players already have in the PS5 and PS4 libraries. But “Cross-Buy” would also give players coming from PC who are otherwise new to the PlayStation console ecosystem a better foothold if their existing Sony purchases can be redeemed across both platforms.
Or maybe Sony is exploring a more hybrid PC gaming handheld approach in the vein of the Xbox Ally X. It’s easy to speculate but hard to say with no concrete info to go on. The most interesting takeaway, however, is that Microsoft’s recent moves might be forcing Sony to compete in unexpected ways. The tech giant might be retreating from the traditional console hardware market, but its wider platform initiatives could still be pushing PlayStation to offer players better features in the future.

88,2025-11-05,"Tokenized equity specialist Dinari is tapping oracle network Chainlink LINK$14.87 for pricing data to bring the S&P DJI's upcoming crypto-focused index onchain, the firms told CoinDesk on Wednesday.
The S&P Digital Markets 50 Index will track 35 public companies involved in blockchain tech and 15 top cryptocurrencies. Dinari will create a token of the index using its ""dShares"" offering, allowing investors to gain exposure to traditional financial (TradFi) and crypto markets through a single digital asset. Each dShare is backed 1:1 with the underlying stock and held by a regulated custodian, preserving rights such as dividends and redemptions.
While S&P DJI is not backing the token itself, the index provider confirmed that Chainlink’s integration ensures the data powering it meets standards for transparency and reliability.
Chainlink’s will use its decentralized oracle network to ensure the index reflects up-to-date market performance directly on blockchain protocols. Oracles are services which supply blockchains with information from the real world that may be required to inform blockchain programs like smart contracts.
""By powering the S&P Digital Markets 50 Index, Chainlink is enabling one of the first indexes to operate onchain with verifiable, real-time index data that spans both traditional and digital assets,"" Fernando Vazquez, president of capital markets at Chainlink Labs, said in a statement.
The initiative fits into a broader trend of bringing TradFi instruments such as bonds, funds and equities, often called real-world assets (RWA), onto blockchain rails.
RWA platform Centrifuge unveiled in September what it called the first licensed S&P 500 index fund onchain, SPXA, traded on Coinbase’s Base network and managed by Janus Henderson and Centrifuge’s Anemoy.

After a year defined by volatility and political uncertainty, Wall Street is heading into the holiday season on a high note — but it may be dampened by the existential threat of AI shaking up their jobs.
Year-end bonuses are projected to rise across nearly every business line, according to a new report released Wednesday by compensation consultancy Johnson Associates, with traders being the big winners — who could see up to 25% increases — followed by mergers advisors and wealth managers. Only a handful of sectors, like real estate and venture capital, were projected to remain flat.
""It's a remarkable, not only recovery, but a broad-based recovery across classes — the sexy and the mundane have all kind of moved up together,"" said Alan Johnson, the firm's founder. ""Which is unusual.""
Yet the same report delivers a warning that automation is about to reshape the financial workforce. Head count could fall 10% to 20% in the next three to five years as banks and asset managers accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence to streamline operations and trim costs, it warns.
""If you have skills, you may do better,"" Johnson told Business Insider. ""There'll be fewer of you — but you'll be cherished more.""
That said, David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, recently said at a conference that he thought the firm would have more employees — not fewer — in the coming decade, precisely because of AI.
For Wall Street, last year's bonus pool was big. A survey from the recruiting firm Prospect Rock Partners found that 2024 bonuses at Wall Street investment banks ranged from nearly $50,000 for early-career bankers to upward of $850,000 for managing directors; group heads, on average, took home $1.7 million in incentive compensation. Overall, the New York State Comptroller found that bonuses for financial services reached nearly $48 billion total.
The industry's gains shine a light on the widening chasm between Wall Street and Main Street, Johnson said, agreeing with lawmakers who say ""if you make under $200,000 or $250,000 in America, you may be hurting. If you make under $100,000, you may be hungry. I think that's well said."" He added: ""People who aren't as well off enough continue not to get ahead.""
Here's a look at a few of the predictions from the report and what banks' incentive-comp pools may hold for Wall Street denizens.
While volatility made 2025 unpredictable at times, it powered traders to windfall results. Johnson Associates projects bonuses for equity sales and trading professionals will climb between 15% and 25% this year, making them the biggest winners on Wall Street. Fixed income sales and trading, as well as debt underwriting, are both expected to increase by 5% to 15%, according to the report.
""The banks are doing well with the volatility in the markets, the advisory business, the M&A business are finally doing well,"" he said, predicting tailwinds into 2026.
President Donald Trump's tariffs jolted global markets through the second quarter, sparking a surge in trading volumes that made traders the standout stars on bank CEOs' earnings calls. Morgan Stanley led its rival investment banks in equity trading revenue this past quarter, generating more than $4.1 billion — $1 billion more than the same quarter last year.
Other bonus projections by the firm included a 7% to 12% increase for traditional asset management, 2.5% to 10% or more for hedge funds, and 2.5% to 5% for insurance, all compared with 2024 levels.
Incentive compensation for the advisory bankers who handle mergers and acquisitions is expected to rise 10% to 15% this year — the strongest since 2021 — as dealmaking activity rebounded sharply this fall.
""We had a clogging in '24 and the first two quarters of '25. We captured some of that in the second half of this year, but a lot will flow into next year,"" Johnson said. ""Banks get paid when the deals close, not when they're announced.""
Advisory revenues returned this autumn, reviving hopes inside major firms of a new ""golden age"" for investment banking. Strategic corporate deals have returned, Johnson said, underscoring CEO confidence, while private-equity sponsors remain wary because they're not hitting pricing levels that would justify a sale.
""Sponsor activity continues to be spotty,"" Johnson said — perhaps why private equity bonuses at mid- and small-cap firms are expected to be flat; larger firms may enjoy bonus increases of 5%. Those who work in secondaries, the part of the business that extends funds' life, may enjoy bonuses upward of 10%.
""They have an enormous amount of dry powder. Prices are elevated. The real problem for a lot of the illiquid investments is simply that they didn't do a great job of underwriting deals in '21 or '22,"" he added, ""so part of the reason we don't have more exits is that they can't get the prices they're looking for.""
As more executives and founders take their companies to market, the wave of capital-generating events is minting new millionaires, boosting bonuses for private wealth advisors. The flood of money in the markets has fed an ""advisor talent war,"" the report notes.
Wealth management is a highly desirable area for banks to enter, Johnson said, citing the rise in high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth clients who need personalized financial advice. For banks, this is something of a goldmine because the business doesn't tie up much capital, generates recurring fees, and can conceivably hang onto clients for decades to come.
Plus, he suggested that this area of finance may be buttressed from AI's job-replacing effects, at least for the foreseeable future. While artificial intelligence can enhance portfolio management solutions, he said, clients continue to want a human advisor handling their savings — particularly older generations who hold much of the wealth. Wealth management pay is expected to climb 8% to 10%, and family-office incentives by 5% to 8%, the report forecasted.
Asked what surprised him about this year's results, Johnson said it was that 2025 is ending on a high note. ""Earlier in the year, we said there's only a 30% chance that things can turn out really well,"" he said. ""Clearly, we're in the better part of the 30%.""

However, the Finland-based group has published a set of new, mid-term targets that include a goal of seeing the company’s organic sales rise more quickly than the wider market.
“Our updated strategy takes us back to the fundamentals, improving profitability and putting Anora back on a growth path. We do it by cutting complexity, restoring margins and cash flow, and focusing on the growth of our core brands. At the same time, we are pursuing selective expansion into new channels and categories, supported by disciplined international growth,” Anora CEO Kirsi Puntila said.
The new targets, which cover a period up to the end of 2028, also include a 6-7% rise in annual “comparable EBITDA”. Anora has a goal for this metric to reach €85-90m ($97.6-103.3m) by the end of 2028.
During 2025 and 2026, the company is targeting around €20m in gross EBITDA savings with a focus on “procurement, organisational streamlining and operational efficiency”, it said in a statement yesterday (4 November).
Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis.
In September, Anora announced another round of job cuts in a bid to “improve profitability and efficiency”. The group had already axed jobs in 2024.
The new strategy will also see the company embark on “structural initiatives” to boost profits and “competitiveness”, including within its supply chain and an “optimisation” of its portfolio. Those moves will “unlock” another gross €20m in EBITDA potential” by 2028, Anora said.
The group said it believed it could boost EBITDA by a further €10m through “growth in core, selective new channels, and disciplined international expansion”.
“Looking ahead, we believe in our core brands, while we recognise the need to expand our range of low and no-alcoholic beverages, invest in innovations and shift towards more sustainable packaging solutions,” Puntila added.

                    Early September, a massive law enforcement operation in Argentina targeted a global IPTV piracy network's business in Latin America. The aim was to shut down dozens of branded services including My Family Cinema, TV Express and Eppi Cinema, that were being targeted at the Brazilian market. With surprisingly few concerns that reliability of IPTV services could nosedive, last weekend that's exactly what happened in Brazil. 
        
The action in Argentina two months ago was announced with a reasonable level of detail. Targeting dozens of IPTV services with an estimated eight million global subscribers, Spanish football league LaLiga described the operation as “historic” and as the dust settled, its importance wasn’t in doubt.
Following an investigation by the Cybercrime Prosecutor’s Office of San Isidro (UFEIC), most likely fueled by investigations carried out by LATAM anti-piracy group Alianza, MPA/ACE, Nagravision, and others in the region, local police raided four office buildings in Vicente López, Buenos Aires.
The raids were conducted under the authority of San Isidro Guarantees Court No. 4 and images of DDI agents and tables covered with cash were soon circulating online. Publishing a statement containing a long list of branded and ‘dismantled’ IPTV services can end badly; however, LaLiga seemed unusually confident that resurrection wouldn’t play a role here.
LaLiga Seemed More Confident Than Usual
While there were no immediate reports of an existential IPTV crisis in Brazil, complaints about service issues were still quick to arrive and only seemed to increase throughout September.
On-screen notices announcing a service’s demise aren’t especially common but since early September, IPTV subscribers in Brazil have been exposed to quite a few of them. 
An early casualty was ‘My Family Cinema’ which had been one of the most recognizable IPTV brands in the region. The notice reportedly came via a set-top box update; some reports implied that updates were probably required to get back in the game.
End of the road for “this brand”…




LaLiga’s presumed confidence that services wouldn’t rise from the dead seemed to look a little precarious given the terminology in the shutdown announcement. Indeed, some former customers claimed that My Family Cinema was subsequently “taken over” by another service called VELA. 
Intermittent service and other errors were reported there too, at least for a while.
Easy come, easy go….




Reports that My Family Cinema was still partly operational continued through October but perhaps more ominous news had already began to surface. 
People keen to renew their subscriptions to various services complained that was no longer possible. Some said that after ‘upgrading’ to VELA and upgrading again to another substitute service (Konex), payments were successful. Or rather, payments went through as expected but resulted in either no service or a service with ads.
With some users preparing to dust off their torrent clients and others mulling the pros and cons of YouTube, heated discussions over consumer rights – including the possibility that the services were executing some kind of exit scam – helped to descend the situation further into chaos. 
From a rightsholders’ perspective, mistrust and declining confidence in piracy are valuable commodities. Few things focus the mind more than throwing good money after bad, and if pirates pick up the blame, it doesn’t get much better than that.
Consumer rights failure…




Official news on how the case is progressing appears to be almost non-existent. 
A comment from anti-piracy group Alianza confirmed that the legal process is indeed under seal. The practical issues observed on the ground are probably linked to advances made by the Argentine Public Prosecutor’s Office in its ongoing investigations against the platform’s operators, the theory goes. 
Other information provided by Alianza clarifies that the eight million subscriber estimate concerns the network’s peak worldwide. Working on the basis of 6.2 million subscribers more recently, Alianza claims that 4.6 million subscribers can be found in Brazil, together generating between US$150 million and US$200 million.
As for the network’s operational structure, Alianza president Jorge Bacaloni says that management, IT/technical, and financial matters are handled in China. 
The investigation in Argentina reportedly concerns a ‘command center’ that controls/coordinates pirate services across the region. An office in Buenos Aires was reportedly responsible for marketing the services and for what could be over US$100m in global piracy sales. 
Since there are signs that new services are easily launched and if necessary, devices with subscriptions to defunct services can be remotely updated to access another service, common ownership/control seems a reasonable explanation, in broad terms at least.
Proving that’s actually the case to a criminal standard is quite rightly a matter for the prosecutor’s office. However, if there’s a central marketing/sales operation common to some or even all of the named services, that should be much easier to discover. 
Since Alianza provided no real clues, we cannot say whether the marketing company apparently used by some of the IPTV services is just a marketing company, or whether it’s THE marketing company referenced by Alianza. 
What we can confirm is that in this instance, zero effort was expended to hide the connections, despite that being technically trivial. What that says in the bigger picture, if indeed it says anything at all, is for the prosecutor’s office to determine. 





Other signs that the overall business was approached from otherwise legitimate angles, include the trademark applications for ‘My Family Cinema’ filed in Paraguay. 
Given that there are copyright complaints filed against several branded services and other entities with links to them, why it took around six years to take action is unclear. Perhaps timing and opportunity are still the most important factors.

94,2025-11-05,"Now, that's a big short.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

As if to prove the circularity of art imitating life imitating art imitating life, the guy who got famous for his portrayal in the 2015 movie The Big Short, Michael Burry, has just placed a $1 billion bet against Nvidia and AI specialist Palantir. That is, quite literally, a big short on Nvidia.
Thanks to both the film and reality, Burry made his name foreseeing the sub-prime housing market collapse and World Financial Crisis it precipitated in 2008. Fair to say he has form when it comes to predicting financial catastrophe.
According to Fortune, it seems Burry sees just such a calamity befalling Nvidia. His hedge fund, known as Scion Asset Management, has reportedly bought $1 billion in put options on Nvidia and another AI-adjacent company, Palantir.
In really simple terms, put options give the holder the right to sell a company's stock at a fixed price in the future rather than the prevailing market price. In practice, put options are typically a device with which to bet against company, the idea being that if the price of the company goes down by the time the option matures, that gives you the opportunity, in effect, to buy the stock at the lower price and then resell at the higher ""strike"" price defined by the option. And then you pocket the difference, ker-ching!
Anywho, this move by Burry, revealed in regulatory filings, only adds to the burgeoning narrative of a massive tech bubble centred on Nvidia. Burry himself obliquely referred to this in an X post on October 31 which said, ""Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,"" above an image of Christian Bale depicting Burry himself in The Big Short.
Of course, just because Burry got the WFC right, doesn't mean he's got this right. Back in January 2023, Burry made a single-word post, ""Sell"" on then-Twitter, only to delete his account shortly thereafter.
 



Here we are, over two years later, and the likes of the NASDAQ and S&P 500 stock indexes are at all time highs and Burry's implied petition to exit the market in 2023 looks a little premature, to say the least. As one wag on X put it in reply to Burry's latest warning, ""you've called nine of the last one bubbles."" Ouch.
Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.
Still, Burry is hardly the only major market player who doesn't like the look of the huge amounts of money currently being thrown about in the name of AI. Investing guru Warren Buffet has reportedly taken $6 billion out of the markets of late.
In reality, what happens from here is anyone's guess. Should AI turn out to deliver on all the hype, even Nvidia's recent $5 trillion market valuation may seem modest. Or maybe the industry will struggle to get past its current slop-generating phase, in which case it all goes pop. But at least if the worst does happen, perhaps Nvidia will pay a bit more attention to gaming graphics cards again. We can but hope.

week and was 151 percent higher than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase
Index decreased 1 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 2 percent
compared with the previous week and was 26 percent higher than the same week one year ago.

“Mortgage rate movements were mixed last week as Treasury yields moved slightly higher following last
week’s FOMC meeting. The 30-year fixed rate was mostly unchanged at 6.31 percent and remained
close to the lowest level in over a year,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s Vice President and Deputy Chief
Economist. “Despite a decline last week, refinance applications are still significantly higher than a year
ago. The average loan size for refinance applications was at its highest level in six weeks, as borrowers
with larger loans continued to seek ways to lower their monthly payments. Purchase applications declined
slightly from a week ago, however, there was slight increase in FHA purchase applications as prospective
homebuyers continue to seek loan options to help manage challenging affordability conditions.”

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances
($806,500 or less) increased to 6.31 percent from 6.30 percent, with points remaining unchanged at 0.58
(including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

97,2025-11-05,"NEW YORK — Animoca Brands wants to become institutional investors' proxy to a growing altcoin market, its co-founder told CoinDesk Monday.
Animoca announced its intention to list on Nasdaq through a reverse merger with Currenc Group on Monday morning, pledging to create a conglomerate that will allow institutional and retail investors to access what will essentially become an altcoin index vehicle, similar to Strategy (MSTR) or Sharplink (SBET) — but for a basket of tokens.
Institutional-ready altcoins are currently a quarter of the overall crypto market, said Yat Siu, the co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca. The company was founded in 2011, but did not enter the crypto world until 2017.
""I think we're uniquely positioned for that,"" he said. ""If you're an institution, you know you're going to buy bitcoin, going to buy Ethereum, you're going to buy solana, and then you have all these other altcoins, which is like a quarter of the market. You're like, 'How do I do this?' And instead of trying to pick winners, which is almost impossible, you can pick Animoca. That's kind of how we think.""
By altcoins, Siu is not referring to any and all tokens outside of the biggest names right now, but rather, ""institutionally ready altcoins,"" tokens with use cases, Siu told CoinDesk Monday afternoon in midtown Manhattan.
""The other tokens are where there's, no question, more volatility, but much more growth potential,"" he said. ""It's those tokens that people are using and adopting … and it's going to be very difficult for an investor who wants to have some exposure to the space, to basically participate in altcoins, because how is it going to know what to pick?""
Animoca aims to answer that question through its portfolio of investments. It's invested in over 600 different companies developing tokens touching a number of different fields, Siu said. According to a snapshot of 100 tokens Animoca's invested in on CoinMarketCap, they range from Web3 gaming to decentralized identity to real-world asset tokenization, among other areas.
There's still a way before Animoca can get there. The company announced a proposed acquisition with Currenc, but first the companies need to finalize their documentation, work out board composition, confirm their merger ratio, get shareholder approval and secure regulatory approval. The companies said in their press release they were targeting a late 2026 debut, a timeline Siu reiterated on Monday: ""This whole process, in our estimation, is going to take about nine to 12 months.""
Should this all happen as planned, Siu said, it will enable ""democratize access"" to the broader cryptocurrency market.
""Most of the world still doesn't have crypto and understand crypto at the end of the day,"" he said. ""We're still, relatively speaking, in the minority, as hundreds of millions of people own crypto, but there's billions who don't. Those billions do have access to the stock market, or at least ways in which you can participate in that field. And to me, we need to have a vehicle to have them have access to the early stage development of the businesses that, frankly, have potentially bigger growth potential.""
