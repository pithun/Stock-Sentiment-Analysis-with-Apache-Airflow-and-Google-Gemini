What gives Michael Burry his rizz?
Short-sellers have long been despised by the retail investing crowd, who have often taken bullish positions on the stocks short-sellers are betting will fall.

Inside Business stories reveal the inner workings of companies from Silicon Valley to Wall Street that are shaping our world today.
""The Big Short"" investor, though, seems to be an exception.
The founder of Scion Asset Management skyrocketed to fame after successfully predicting the 2008 market crash. His ability to beat Wall Street banks at their own game is a source of inspiration for a lot of retail investors. It earned him enduring celebrity status, even after he stuck his neck out to bet against some of the market's most popular stocks, like Palantir and Nvidia.
But, while other short-sellers — Andrew Left and Gabe Plotkin come to mind — have drawn online hate, Burry's bets have seemingly never made him more popular. Global search interest in his name soared 769% to a new peak this month, according to data obtained from the Google Trends analytics tool Glimpse.
Burry deregistered his hedge fund this week, fueling excited speculation among retail investors about what the iconic market bear will do next.
""He's speaking the language of the retail investor, which is to go against the prevailing wind in the market,"" Michael Brown, senior researcher at Pepperstone, said.
A few things might explain why Burry gets a pass from a crowd that normally shuns short-sellers.
Burry made $700 million for his clients and took in around $100 million himself as the subprime mortgage crisis kicked off the Great Recession.
But it's not just that Burry was right. It's also that his now-legendary call that the housing market would unravel came at the expense of Wall Street.
The big banks are among the cast of villains in retail trader forums, and Burry's David vs. Goliath backstory is also how many envision their fight against other short sellers who bet against their favorite meme stocks, like Andrew Left and Gabe Plotkin.
Plotkin's hedge fund became the primary target of retail traders in 2021 as they pumped GameStop shares to record highs. His losses mounted to the billions in days, leading his firm to close its doors about a year later.
""I'm glad this piss bag is broke. I hope he's not the only one either,"" one user wrote in a thread about Plotkin on Reddit.
Burry's online persona is also more offbeat compared to other investors. Since his return to X, the Scion founder has posted Star Wars memes and batted away rumors that he was 5'6"".
Speaking to Vanity Fair in 2010, Burry said he believes he sees the world differently, in part because he has one glass eye after a childhood cancer diagnosis. He has also spoken about being diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome.
In the post-crisis years, Burry's mystique has grown, largely due to his sporadic appearances and disappearances on social media, where he drops breadcrumbs regarding his thinking that often run counter to prevailing market narratives.
This is important for retail investors, who often feel they have an inside story or theory about why a particular stock is misunderstood. Recent surges in Opendoor and Beyond Meat are examples of this phenomenon.
For the most part, Burry is calling more bubbles, and his prognostications have fueled theories and discussions on retail trader forums. However, it's unclear if investors are necessarily following Burry's advice. On r/Burryology, his stock calls are received with a mix of enthusiasm and trepidation.
""Maybe because his shorts are not working as expected?"" one user wrote in a thread discussing a recent social media post Of Burry's that said he believed the AI hyperscalers would eventually overstate their earnings by as much as 26%.
""Michael burry? Ah yes the guy who has predicted a market crash every year since the stock market began,"" another user wrote on a separate r/investing thread.
There are likely a good number of retail investors who will continue to view Burry as a ""godlike"" figure, Brown said.
""But yeah, they're probably not going to be in those positions for very long if past performance is anything to go by,"" he added.
Burry, who has repeatedly warned of a stock crash in recent years, is now more closely aligned with the market zeitgeist as fears of a stock market bubble grow louder on Wall Street.
""People say I didn't warn last time,"" he wrote in a now-deleted post from 2021. ""I did, but no one listened. So I warn this time. And still, no one listens. But I will have proof I warned.""
Burry also recently updated his profile name to ""Cassandra Unchained,"" an allusion to the Greek mythological figure who was cursed to make accurate prophecies but never to be believed.
""This all plays into existing concerns around the size of investment in AI, doubts over whether there will ever be a decent return, along with the circular nature of these investments. I've no doubt his retail followers take this very seriously,"" David Morrison, a senior market analyst at Trade Nation, told Business Insider.

Could it be the start of a new era for Berkshire Hathaway before Warren Buffett even vacates the CEO chair?
The famed investor's company purchased 17.8 million shares of Alphabet last quarter, a position worth $4.3 billion as of September 30, a regulatory filing revealed on Friday.
Alphabet — the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo — is a technology titan with a $3.4 trillion market capitalization. The search-and-advertising giant has been one of the ""hyperscalers"" fueling the stock market's AI boom; its stock has surged 46% this year.
Buffett, 95, has eschewed tech companies for most of his career, preferring to stay within his famous ""circle of competence"" and invest in industries he deeply understands, such as insurance, banks, and railroads.
He famously made an exception for Apple, which remains among Berkshire's biggest portfolio holdings despite Buffett paring the company's stake in the iPhone maker in recent quarters.
Berkshire continued that trend last quarter, reducing its Apple position by 15% to 238 million shares, worth about $61 billion at September's close. It also pared its key Bank of America stake by 6%.
Buffett has lamented not investing in Google several times over the years, saying ""we blew it"" on one occasion. It may have been one of his two investment managers, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who established the new position.
The billionaire is set to step down as CEO before the new year. He has spent the past six decades transforming Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a world-beating conglomerate with a $1 trillion market value. Under his watch, it has acquired scores of subsidiaries including Geico and Dairy Queen, and built huge stakes in household names such as Coca-Cola and American Express.
Berkshire's third-quarter earnings foreshadowed its disposals. They showed that Buffett and his team spent $6.4 billion on stocks but sold $12.5 billion worth, making them net sellers for a 12th straight quarter. Its latest portfolio update shows Alphabet made up the lion's share of its purchases lat quarter.
Buffett, perhaps the world's foremost bargain hunter, has struggled to find deals in recent years as stocks have surged to record levels, fierce competition has driven up the price of acquisitions, and buybacks have grown unattractive with Berkshire stock near all-time highs.
Berkshire's coffers have swelled as a result. After subtracting Treasury payables, its cash pile rose to a record $358 billion last quarter. One of the most vital tasks for his successor, Greg Abel, will be putting that war chest to work.
Despite his challenges, Buffett struck an optimistic tone in his Thanksgiving letter to shareholders this week, saying that he still spots the occasional opportunity, and he expects Berkshire to fare well in the years ahead.

2,2025-11-14,"Shopping for new bras always sounds like a good idea in theory, but it can quickly become frustrating in practice. Finding the perfect balance between fit, comfort, style, and support can feel nearly impossible, but Honeylove's internet-famous bras excel in every category. The brand also offers flattering and buttery-soft shapewear and apparel, all of which is up to 50% off during Honeylove's early Black Friday sale.
This isn't the first time I've seen Honeylove's entire site up to half off, but I've yet to see prices drop any lower, so now's as good a time as any to finally replace your years-old bras. There are plenty of style editor favorites among the markdowns, including the best bralette for large busts and the best shapewear bodysuit we've ever tested. For more products we love and sizing tips, check out our full Honeylove review.
Ahead, shop our favorite deals from Honeylove's early Black Friday sale on items we recommend. Some of these items are on final sale, so don't miss your chance to snag them before they're out of stock for good. For more early deals across all categories, head over to the rest of our Black Friday coverage.

                      The Honeylove Silhouette Bra fits like a glove, and thanks to all the supportive features. It's wireless for comfort, but still delivers a great shaping and lifting effect.
                    

                      Made with Italian stretch woven fabric, these pants instantly elevate any outfit with ankle slit details and princess seams. They feature shaping panels for a flattering fit and are both wrinkle-resistant and machine washable. 
                    

                      Available in three colors, this nightdress is ultra soft and breathable, made with cooling Tencel fabric and mesh panels for extra airflow. It also has adjustable straps for the perfect fit.
                    

                      This bra's soft and stretchy microfiber feels like a second skin, and there's just enough firm compression to help you feel secure and supported. It's hardware-free with bonded seams, making it invisible under clothing, and the bonding at the cradle helps to lend a little extra lift.
                    

                       The SuperPower Short offers waist-to-thigh smoothing, and despite their high level of compression, they don't feel restrictive. Thanks to the anti-slip silicone strips at the top of the waistband and structured boning down the sides and upper back, the SuperPower Shorts don't shift around or roll down.

What if offensive people played at scamming each other with fictitious assets, as if they had a sandbox to play in, while the real economy sustained itself because of a basic income? If those virtual assets crash, why should it spread by contagion and impose scarcity on the most vulnerable?
So if I read this right, insiders are setting the value of something that doesn't physically exist, investors buy into something that doesn't exist, then when the value of the thing that doesn't exist goes down and investors try to sell the thing that doesn't exist, the insiders buy the thing that doesn't exist for less than it was worth when it was sold, so they pocket s profit on the trading of something that didn't exist.
Wow talk about falling off the common sense cliff.
I don't think it's quite that.
Normally, if I'm going to create a fund what I do is raise money from investors, go out and buy the underlying assets for my fund and then give the investors shares.
The investors get two things, access to my skill at investing, and the ability to spread their risk across the market without having to have hundreds of separate holdings.
What's happening here is, instead, the fund is being funded by assets the fund manager already holds but aren't really liquid and so are hard to price.
But once they've sold the shares in the fund, they've sold their hard to value asset for cash without having to actually find a buyer for a multi-hundred million holding or even having to properly value it.
Yes, similar to an etf.
Perhaps a non-crypto example would be an ETF property fund.
Except the fund was formed by the investors putting in property they held rather than money.
Then they offload the ETF shares to the unsuspecting investor who trusts the value the fund has put on its assets.
Need to get Drew Carey to narrate this.
""where everything is made up and the points don't matter.""
And now that the economy is becoming increasingly predicated on vapourcoin 'currencies', my sig seems even more relevant!
I might have to change it though, now that even people who have a few decades behind them also are - or are poised to to be - ""pitiable suckers"".

If anything could ever justify requiring ""qualified investors"", it's financial novelties.  That retail investors would be exposed to this but aren't allowed to invest in the funds that make the rich richer, is a bright red sign indicating something is wrong with our financial regulations.  

Private equity - sorry, too complicated for the average investor.  You already have to be rich to use this straightforward thing that makes you richer.
Hedge funds - sorry, too complicated for the average investor.  You already have to be rich to use this slightly complicated thing that makes you richer. 
Digital Asset Treasuries - very complicated, brand new, very high risk, probably a scam and definitely a way to hide a scam.  Go for it!  

I'm just not yet sure if the problem is too much or too little regulation.
I figured at this point I was wrong about crypto, but I guess it was once again a case of the market being irrational longer than expected.

Numbers are too big now. Just before Halloween, Nvidia made headlines for becoming the first $5 trillion company in history. A week later, Tesla’s shareholders approved a pay package for Elon Musk that could be worth about $1 trillion in a decade. At a certain point, figures this large become uncomfortably meaningless. A million dollars is a lot of money. A billion dollars is a heck of a lot—so much that if you had it, you’d be a billionaire. Now try to imagine how rich you would be if you were pulling in $8 billion every month for the next 10 years, as Musk is effectively about to do. It’s impossible. “The numbers are so big, they are hard to comprehend,” Jeff Sommer recently wrote in The New York Times. And he’s the paper’s finance columnist.
Sommer was referring to the stock market, which has been on an outrageous tear, with the gains concentrated among a tiny number of unfathomably valuable companies. The S&P 500 has doubled since October 2022, which is impressive on its own, but the combined market cap of the Magnificent Seven—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—has more than quadrupled. These firms are all heavily invested in generative AI, a technology based on training computers to make connections among quantities of data that are completely beyond human understanding. Large numbers are generating large numbers.
Records are being broken before they’ve had time to sink in. Nvidia’s $5 trillion valuation last month surpassed the first-ever $4 trillion valuation, which was also achieved by Nvidia, in July. The planet didn’t even have a single trillion-dollar company until Apple hit that milestone in 2018. This was considered a big deal at the time. Now the equivalent of the most valuable corporation in history circa 2018 can be generated in three months.
Matteo Wong and Charlie Warzel: Here’s how the AI crash happens
These wild numbers make all other sums sound trivial, even when they aren’t. On Tuesday, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank disclosed that it had sold its entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia to fund other investments. That was important enough to make news basically everywhere. But we’re talking about one one-thousandth of Nvidia’s market cap here. Is $5.8 billion a lot, or is it lunch money?
As a species, we aren’t ready for this. People basically can’t tell the difference between any number that ends in -illion, and the more zeros you add, the worse things get. One experiment at the University of Richmond asked a group of students and graduates to plot numbers on a line. Half of them thought it made sense to evenly space 1,000, 1 million, and 1 billion. Another study asked people to rate the effectiveness of proposed COVID-relief packages. Responses differed sharply when the options were presented in per-capita amounts (giving everyone $1,200 was deemed much less effective than $24,000) but hardly at all when they were presented as total amounts ($100 billion versus $2 trillion), even though the ratio was the same in each case.
As the numbers grow, our understanding of reality dims. This is true even for some of our most influential thinkers. On Monday, Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that the United States would forfeit $2 trillion in revenue should the Supreme Court strike down his tariffs. The very next day, the president claimed that the number was $3 trillion. Even the smaller number would, if true, have been enough to completely wipe out the federal deficit. In fact, the U.S. has raised only about $200 billion in customs duties in the past fiscal year. The total U.S. debt, meanwhile, has risen to $38 trillion, a number so self-evidently absurd that the mind resists dwelling on it. It must be funny money. If it weren’t, it could never have gotten so big.
Rogé Karma: The debt is about to matter again
The prospects for democratic self-governance are not good. Raising and spending money is one of the most fundamental functions of government. If neither citizens nor their leaders can wrap their heads around these numbers, how will anyone make informed decisions about how the country is run? A trillion here, a trillion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money.
Nor can our age of hyper-numbers be easily dismissed as the familiar product of inflation. Everyone grows up hearing about how cheap things were when our parents were kids—how you could buy a new Chrysler back then for the cost of a mattress today. Then you get older and have the same experience, puzzling over how movie tickets could possibly cost $16. But economic growth is generally understood to be exponential. The nature of exponential change is that it looks just like non-exponential change, right up until it doesn’t. Economists model growth as a constant percent, such as 3 percent annually. This sounds innocuous but leads to absolute numbers that elude our comprehension. If you plot out the value of an economy that grows by just a few percentage points a year, and you set a long-enough time frame, your chart will look like a plateau that suddenly explodes into a vertical line.
That is exactly what linear graphs of the U.S. stock market look like right now, which suggests that we have achieved escape velocity and entered the vertical part of the curve. (The geniuses who put historical stock-market graphs together tend to conceal this fact by using a logarithmic scale, which makes big jumps look much smaller.) The bigger the numbers get, the faster they grow in absolute terms. In just a few years, a $5 trillion valuation might sound as quaint as a $2,000 two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn does today. The recent stock-market surge has brought about this moment sooner than it otherwise would have arrived, and a bursting bubble could defer it, but not forever. Nvidia could lose half of its value, and it would still be worth $2.5 trillion.
One solution, childish in its simplicity, is for the government to unilaterally deflate the currency by decreeing that all dollar figures will henceforth be reduced by an order of magnitude—that is, they will drop a zero—like a stock split on the dollar. This would render Nvidia a mere $500 billion company and buy us all some time to absorb that fact. This technique is known as redenomination. It has been used to reduce nominal prices in countries experiencing out-of-control inflation, but to my knowledge, it has never been deployed to ease the cognitive burden of a stock market that is performing too well. Alas, like all perfect ideas, this will never happen. Instead, the numbers will keep growing, faster and faster, and we will remain strapped against our will to this exponential rocket, hurtling into the Milky Way, which contains only about 400 billion stars, tops. But who’s counting?

Mini PCs offer a third option from laptops and desktop PCs if you’re looking to run Windows without spending too much cash. They work brilliantly as dedicated work stations, supplemental devices to your other devices to get work done, or as your main device if you don’t want to take up too much space. They even make for handy little gaming units. This GMKtec mini gaming PC happens to be on sale right now too. Amazon has the GMKtec K12 Gaming Mini PC discounted by 31% ahead of Black Friday. For a limited time, you can grab this mini gaming PC for $220 off, bringing the price down from $720 to just $500.
As the name of the product category implies, a mini PC takes up substantially less room than a standard PC would. Heck, you can even reduce it’s footprint to zero by mounting it to the back of your display or monitor.
See at Amazon
Taking a peak into the specs, The GMKtec mini PC is working with a Ryzen 7 H 255 processor. That has eight cores and 16 threads, an can run at up to 4.9 GHz. Paired with the powerful Radeon 780M iGPU, you can even get some decent gaming done with this hardware. The K12 mini PC is equipped with dual 16GB RAM, totaling to 32GB. It comes with a 512GB SSD but three SSD slots are available, each capable of reading up to 8TB for a max of 24TB. You get both Wi-Fi 6E support and Bluetooth 5.2 support built in.
The OCuLink port can take your gaming even further. You can actually plug into a beefier graphics card externally to get the gaming boost you’re looking for. Just know the mini PC doesn’t support hotswapping it. You’ll need to turn off the power first before plugging to or unplugging from a graphics card connection.
The base hardware is still pretty powerful, able to display in resolutions up to 8K if you need. It allows for connecting to up to four screens at once. The HDMI 2.1 will grant you up to 8K at 60Hz, the DisplayPort will grant you up to 4K at 60Hz, and the two USB-C can be used for display, though the product page doesn’t specs for those two.
Dual cooling fans help keep the rig from overheating. The two can deliver silent, ultra-efficient cooling at just 35dB. Plus the fans have cool lighting. Wouldn’t be a gaming PC without cool lighting.

Personal care appliances, like powerful hair dryers and easy-to-use shavers, donât have to break the bank. If youâve been looking to upgrade your current setup or grab a useful gift for a loved one, Laifenâs Black Friday sale is a great time to do that.
The sale runs from November 19 through December 5, and it includes up to 40% off some of the brandâs best-selling tools. Weâre talking about the products trusted by celebrity stylists and groomers! Itâs still a couple of days away, but we suggest setting a reminder now, because once the sale goes live, the most popular items are likely to sell out fast.
See at Laifen
The sale will drop the Laifen SE Lite by $40, meaning you can grab it for just $60. This entry-level hair dryer delivers smooth 19m/s airflows that can dry your hair in a short time. It also weighs just 345g and comes with a 6mm shorter air outlet than the SE version, which makes it easy to take it with you on the go.
The Laifen SE + Wave SE bundle will also be going for just $132, down from $220 during the sale. Youâre getting a top-rated hair dryer, plus a dual-tool action electric toothbrush certified by the American Dental Association. The dryer features Laifenâs signature 105,000 rpm brushless motor for quicker, smoother blowouts. You get two attachments; a diffuser nozzle for curly hair and a smooth nozzle for everyday styling. The Temperature Cycling Mode also protects your hair from heat damage in the long run. The toothbrush, on the other hand, delivers 60-degree oscillation and 26,000 vibrations per minute to remove plaque and gingivitis.
Taking care of your beard wonât be a problem either. The Laifen P3 Pro electric razor is also getting a price cut, which drops it to just $135. In a small, compact frame, it comes with dual motors that run at 24,000 CPM, plus a 0.055mm ArcBlade for a smoother, comfortable shave. The battery life is impressive too, as you can go up to 4 months without worrying about plugging it in.
All these deals offer great value, and you will also find a lot more going for less, too. The sale starts on November 19, but thereâs a good chance the best deals wonât stick around for long. Act fast before itâs too late!

14,2025-11-14,"ASUS officially confirmed the ROG Xbox Ally X has been an ""extremely positive"" market hit, with demand exceeding expectations. the company is now ramping up production to meet the gap for the highly desired premium handheld PC.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The first true OEM gaming Xbox launched this year, named the Xbox Ally.
I exclusively leaked the Xbox Ally a few months ago, codenamed Kennan. It would later be revealed during Xbox's June marketing beats, showcasing a big partnership with Windows OEM ASUS, as part of the firm's ROG gaming line-up.
Powered by AMD's Z2-A and Z2 Extreme, the Xbox Ally range is serving as a test bed of sorts for Microsoft. The Windows flight on the Xbox Ally represents the operating system going into the next-gen Xbox, powered by full-blown Windows.
The experience overall is solid, but a variety of issues remain for the Xbox Ally range from a usability perspective. From a gaming perspective, the Xbox Ally X is currently the most powerful handheld in the world, and provides the best handheld experience for Xbox gaming yet. But, how well is it doing in the real world?
Today during ASUS' investor meeting, the firm revealed that it expects the Ally range to generate between $96 million and $160 million USD this quarter, and eventually settling between $130m and $160 million in future quarters.
CORRECTION: Asus said the Xbox ROG Ally X handheld has seen high demand and is in short supply. Expects to generate NT$ 3 to 5 billion ($96m - $160m) in sales from its Ally line this quarter, stabilizing at around NT$ 4 to 5 billion each quarter ($130m - $160m).November 13, 2025
Windows PC OEMs generally propagate dozens of hardware SKUs in smaller amounts to target specific sub sections of users and price points. Razer is currently selling three main laptop SKUs as of writing, across a variety of configurations. The ASUS ROG line is no different, with a variety of accessories, PC components, laptop models, and now, PC gaming handhelds to speak of.
ASUS admitted in its investor call that it misjudged demand for the Xbox Ally X top-end model, which starts at $999.
Responding to a question from investment mega bank Morgan Stanley, ASUS described how the Xbox Ally range had exceeded expectations. ""As many of you know, we introduced the first generation ROG Ally 2-3 years ago as a market pioneer, over the past couple of years this new category, especially, the Windows ecosystem has proven itself highly successful,"" ASUS explained.
""We believe that we have achieved our original goals of premium positioning, creating a new growth driver in our gaming segment. That's why we released our third-generation ROG Ally last month. It featured deeper collaboration with Xbox. Since its launch, we see the market response for it has been extremely positive, particularly, there has been an appetite for the premium higher-end models, exceeding our expectations. These high-ended variants are currently in short supply. We are working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that exists. Our goal with the ROG Ally is for it to remain a core pillar within the ASUS gaming portfolio."" 
The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X are a glimpse into Microsoft's plans for the next evolution of the Xbox ecosystem. The next Xbox will use full Windows, leveraging the Xbox Ally's Full Screen Experience and Xbox Game Bar as the primary way to interact with the system. Much like the Xbox Ally, Microsoft will also open up the Xbox ecosystem to other OEMs who want to create their own ""Xbox"" devices, similar to what Steam is doing with Steam OS and the new Steam Machine.
To make the experience truly console-like, Microsoft's Windows and Xbox teams are working more closely than ever before, collaborating towards making the Windows environment more controller-friendly, with boosted multi-tasking and experiences more tailored for living room use.
However, a big question mark hovers over this strategy. Microsoft's attention is heavily divided on Windows, between creating an ""agentic AI"" experience it hopes will boost its chops with enterprises, while also courting gaming consumers who remain sceptical at best with regards to anything labelled ""AI.""
ASUS admitted in its investor call that it misjudged demand for the Xbox Ally X top-end model, which starts at $999.
The Xbox Ally still has a ton of ""PC""-style idiosyncrasies that console gamers don't want. Every time you open a game with any form of online ping, Windows Firewall will complain. Many games have pop-ups of a variety of shapes and sizes, with little to no information on what they actually mean. The full-screen experience also often loses focus, requiring you to tap the screen to regain control of the window — obviously, you won't be able to do that if you're using it with your TV. There are many more issues, but hopefully, these can all be solved relatively easily over time.
There's also the issue of Xbox being more challenging to publish for than other platforms, which excludes the Xbox PC experience native to the Xbox Ally from many AAA and viral indie hits that hit Steam directly. Microsoft is also working to make publishing on Xbox PC more friendly, but will they be able to move fast enough?
Still, it seems that the Xbox Ally has been a hit for ASUS. Could we see other OEMs jump on board in the future? A Razer Xbox? A Lenovo ThinkPad Xbox?! Everything is an Xbox now, apparently. And we should see even more ""Xboxes"" in the future.
The ROG Xbox Ally X is currently in short supply globally, as ASUS admitted that the market demand for the premium model has exceeded expectations.
ASUS stated it is ""working closely with key component suppliers to ramp up production and fill the demand gap that currently exists.""
The market response has been ""extremely positive,"" and ASUS projects the ROG Ally line to generate a significant amount of revenue, viewing it as a new growth driver in its gaming portfolio.
No. ASUS stated that the high demand for the premium, higher-end variant specifically exceeded their expectations, indicating they did not initially produce enough units to meet the rush of early buyers.

15,2025-11-14,"Joe Kiniry, a security expert specializing in elections, was attending an annual conference on voting technology in Washington, DC, when a woman approached him with an unusual offer. She said she represented a wealthy client interested in funding voting systems that would encourage bigger turnouts. Did he have any ideas? “I told her you should stay away from internet voting, because it’s really, really hard,” he says.
Later he learned who had sent her. It was Bradley Tusk, a New York City political consultant and fixer for companies like Uber fending off regulation. He’d made a fortune doing that (early Uber stock helped a lot), and he was eager to spend a good chunk of it pursuing online voting technology. Tusk convinced Kiniry to work with him. At the very least, Kiniry thought, it would be a valuable research project.
Today Tusk is showing off the fruits of that collaboration. His Mobile Voting Foundation is releasing VoteSecure, a cryptography-based protocol that seeks to help people securely cast their votes on iPhones and Androids. The protocol is open source and available on GitHub for anyone to test, improve upon, and build out. Two election technology vendors have already committed to using it—perhaps as early as 2026. Tusk claims that mobile voting will save our democracy. But getting it accepted by legislators and the public will be the really, really hard part.
Tusk has been obsessed with mobile voting for a while. Around 2017, he began taking serious action, funding small elections that used existing technology to allow deployed military or disabled people to vote. He estimates he’s dropped $20 million so far and plans to keep shoveling cash into the effort. When I ask why, he explains that working with the government has given him a panoramic view of its failures. Tusk believes there is a single pressure point that could fix a number of mismatches between what the public deserves and what they get: more people using the ballot box. “We get lousy, or corrupt, government because so few people vote, especially in off-year elections and primaries, where the turnout is dismal,” he says. “If primary turnout is 37 percent instead of 9 percent, the underlying political incentives for an elected official to change—it pushes them to the middle, and they’re not rewarded for screaming and pointing fingers.”
To Tusk, mobile voting is a no-brainer: We already do banking, commerce, and private messages on our phones, so why not cast a ballot? “If I don’t do it, who is going to do it?” he asks. Furthermore, he says, “if it doesn’t happen, I don’t think we’re one country in 20 years, because if you are unable to solve any single problem that matters to people, eventually they decide not to keep going.”
Tusk had Kiniry evaluate existing online voting platforms—including some that Tusk himself had paid for. “Joe is considered the absolute expert on electronic voting,” says Tusk. So when Kiniry deemed those systems insufficient, Tusk decided that the best way forward was to start from scratch. He hired Kiniry’s company, Free & Fair, to develop VoteSecure. It’s not a turnkey solution but a backend part of a system that will require a user interface and other pieces to be operable. The protocol includes a means for voters to check the accuracy of their ballots and verify that their vote has been received by the election board and transferred to a paper ballot.
Tusk says his next step is to “run legislation” in a few cities to allow mobile voting. “Start small—city council, school board, maybe mayor,” he says. “Prove the thesis. The odds of Vladimir Putin hacking the Queensborough election seems pretty remote to me.” (Next spring some local election elections in Alaska will offer the option of mobile-phone voting with software developed by Tusk’s foundation.) Kiniry agrees it’s way too soon to use mobile voting in national elections, but Tusk is betting that eventually the systems become familiar, to the point where people trust them much more than traditional paper ballots. “Once the genie’s out of the bottle, they can’t put it back, right?” he says. “That’s been true for every tech I’ve worked on.” But first the genie has to get out of the bottle. That’s no cinch.
The loudest objections against mobile or internet voting come from cryptographers and security experts, who believe that the safety risks are insurmountable. Take two people who were at the 2017 conference with Kiniry. Ron Rivest is the legendary “R” in the RSA protocol that protects the internet, a winner of the coveted Turing Award, and a former professor at MIT. His view: Mobile voting is far from ready for prime time. “What you can do with mobile phones is interesting, but we’re not there yet, and I haven’t seen anything to make me think otherwise,” he says, “Tusk is driven by trying to make this stuff happen in the real world, which is not the right way to do it. They need to go through the process of writing a peer-reviewed paper. Putting up code doesn’t cut it.”
Computer scientist and voting expert David Jefferson is also unimpressed. Though he acknowledges that Kiniry is one of the country’s top voting system experts, he sees Tusk’s effort as doomed. “I’m willing to concede rock-solid cryptography, but it does not weaken the argument about how insecure online voting systems are in general. Open source and perfect cryptography do not address the most serious vulnerabilities.”
Kiniry, of course, disagrees. “We'll get to that,” he says of a peer-reviewed paper. “But in releasing the first version of it, we have provided the community with something like the equivalent of half a dozen papers for review.” Tusk is even more dismissive. “They’ve never seen what we’ve built,” he says of his critics. He contends that their “zero-tolerance approach” ignores the fact that the current systems aren’t perfect.
All these arguments about the safety and verifiability of mobile voting may be irrelevant. In the not-too-distant past, when Tusk first became consumed with the concept, conversations about election safety were conducted under the guise of science, math, and persnickety accounting. People generally trusted their voting systems, and had reason to—numerous studies have shown that election fraud is involved in only a minuscule fraction of votes cast. That trust no longer exists: In 2025, thanks to one sore loser, the entire issue is fraught with doubt and loathing. Inviting an unfamiliar alternative would be like introducing cordite into the process. Even if a mobile system was verified as 100 percent secure, all it would take to cast suspicion on an election would be a single ill-intended charge that some outside force had hacked the system. Does anyone remember the bogus charges against Dominion Voting Systems? Despite vindication, the company was left so tarnished that it now has different ownership and a different name. Yes, internet voting is really, really hard—but solvable. Less solvable is an electorate that won’t accept a vote count it doesn’t like.

ESPN's return to YouTube TV is still in a rain delay, and the forecast isn't great.
Disney's beef with YouTube TV has lasted two weeks, making it the longest carriage dispute in the Mouse House's history.
The consensus among most experts was the fight wouldn't last long. But with each passing day — and major sporting event — the blackout has dragged on.
Still, with Disney losing roughly $30 million a week, a resolution is right around the corner.
Right? Right?? RIGHT!
Negotiations with YouTube ""could go for a little while,"" Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said on Disney's earnings call Thursday. The company also added a note in the risk factors of its annual filing, stating it ""cannot predict how long this service blackout will last.""
(I'll pause here to say, Disney obviously benefits from its executives holding the line during such a contentious negotiation, so keep that in mind. Also, BI's James Faris has been all over this feud, so follow his coverage here.)
Disney didn't just talk about its YouTube TV tussle, though. CEO Bob Iger also discussed how AI can enhance Disney+ user experiences, writes BI's Lucia Moses.
Still, the AI mention wasn't enough to save that stock, as a miss on revenue expectations sent the stock down almost 8% on Thursday.
Cable subscribers shouldn't gloat, though.
The Disney blackout is only relevant to the roughly 10 million YouTube TV subscribers, but that might not be the case for long.
Disney has other distribution contracts set to expire next year, which could result in additional blackouts. It's potentially another reason the YouTube TV-Disney deal is taking so long to iron out. It'll be the framework other pay-TV providers look to model their own negotiations off of.
Still, Disney's been careful to shift the blame to a third party: sports leagues. Live sports have become a crown jewel for streamers, allowing leagues to charge billions of dollars for the right to broadcast their games.
Of course, there are other ways to stream games.
Pirating games via apps downloaded on the Amazon Fire TV Stick is one popular workaround.  But that loophole is quickly closing as Amazon works to block apps it identified as hosting pirated content.

Bitcoin’s price sank on Friday, dipping below $95,000 before recovering slightly by early afternoon ET. The price currently sits at $95,400, down 3.2% on the day and down 15% from a month ago.
Bitcoin hit a six-month low Friday as the price of cryptocurrencies seemed to be largely tracking the stock market, which frequently happens. Markets opened lower on Friday before similarly rebounding. The S&P 500 is down 1.2% this month, according to CNN, and the Dow is down 0.6%.
Crypto traders often think of themselves as being part of a new financial system, independent of whatever is happening on Wall Street. But price fluctuations often mirror the Dow Jones and NASDAQ, and can often seem even more dramatic with wild swings.
Bitcoin traders often believe they can predict where prices are headed, leading to all kinds of theories that get picked up in the crypto press and applied to Bitcoin. The worrisome chart of the day seems to be the “classic five-phase Wyckoff Distribution,” which CoinTelegraph warns might mean Bitcoin could fall to as low as $86,000. They may as well be reading tea leaves and animal entrails, of course. But gamblers love to have a system.
Three weeks ago, CoinTelegraph ran an article about how Bitcoin could be on track to hit $200,000 by the end of this year. As in 2025. As in six weeks from now.
Bitcoin’s price hit an all-time high above $126,000 back on Oct. 6 but has struggled over the past month as investors pull their money out. Bitcoin magazine reports that roughly 815,000 BTC worth almost $79 billion has been sold by long-time holders in the past 30 days.
The price of other major cryptocurrencies was largely down on Friday, with Ethereum down 1.5% on the day (down 30% over the past three months) and XRP down 2.4% (down 27.4% over the past three months). Binance’s BNB seemed to be the exception to the daily trend, up 0.4% on the day and up 7.62% over the past three months. However, BNB is way down (23.4%) from the highs it reached a month ago, when Bitcoin was also doing well.
If the history of Bitcoin over recent years is any guide, the price is likely to track whatever the stock market does. If you think the U.S. economy is strong and it will continue to get better, you should probably put your money on Bitcoin going up. If you think the economy is weakening and stocks are likely to plunge in the future, you should probably bet on Bitcoin’s price going down.
And if you think that the underlying economy struggling could act like a house of cards to crypto and give us a Sam Bankman-Fried scenario, you really should not bank on Bitcoin going up. SBF got in trouble because he was playing with funny money and ran out of the real stuff to gamble with.
Nobody knows for certain what the future holds. The price of Bitcoin could go up or it could go down.

It's the most wonderful time of the year for shoppers, but Target is trying to reduce the chaos of holiday shopping in its stores.
Target's chief guest experience officer, Cara Sylvester, said customers are craving consistency when shopping in stores. For Target, that means cleaning them up, keeping shelves stocked, and having happy staff members.
It's all part of an effort to keep consumers engaged and shopping the aisles of the winter wonderland that Target is creating throughout its 2,000-plus stores.
Although it's spreading holiday cheer this season, Target hasn't had a joyous past few years. The retailer posted declining comparable sales for six of the past nine quarters under exiting CEO Brian Cornell. Last month, the company said it would be laying off about 1,000 corporate employees and cutting another 800 open roles to help the company move faster and simplify workflows.
Target's chief operating officer and soon-to-be CEO, Michael Fiddelke, has big plans for the retailer that he will helm in February. His strategy is based on ""knowing what makes Target Target,"" Fiddelke said during Target's earnings call in August. The guest experience is one major area he wants to improve.
Target took me on a tour of a New Jersey location, where I stepped into a ""whimsical Alpine world,"" as Sylvester described it to me, to get a preview of how the retailer is revamping its stores to win shoppers back this holiday season.
""We want guests to see, to feel, Target"" when they walk into stores, Sylvester said. It sounds simple enough, but the retailer has struggled with store traffic recently. The goal is to make it ""look beautiful"" with various holiday-themed displays to show off its winter collections.
However, I got the sense that some of the changes aren't just seasonal; they're targeting bigger issues.
If it smells like warm holiday cookies when you first walk into your local Target, that's by design. The store is targeting all five senses, with smell playing a new role. I caught onto the strategy immediately as the automatic doors slid open.
""Smell is actually the strongest of the five senses that triggers memories,"" Sylvester told me.
In addition to the smells, the holiday vibes were established early on by a life-size gondola — similar to one you might find in the Swiss Alps — that's used for photo opportunities during the weekly events hosted at the New Jersey location I visited.
Although there weren't any events scheduled for the Wednesday morning of my tour, my guides told me that toy demonstrations and children's activities would be held weekly leading up to the holidays.
Cozy sweaters and matching knitted sets from Target's Universal Thread brand lined the Alpine Hotel near the entrance of the store. It set the tone for the overall Alpine theme of the store, complete with electronic gondolas hanging from the ceiling.
I caught a vibe that would become a thread throughout the rest of the store. It felt like I'd stopped into a small shop that sold cozy knits and sweaters.
However, it was the same Target outside the Alpine Hotel display. There were still racks and racks of affordable, matching winter pajamas to peruse.
With a six-foot tinsel Christmas tree as the centerpiece, the Holiday Market was hard to miss at the back corner of the store. Although the holiday vibes were sprinkled throughout the store, the Holiday Market is where you'd go to find the decorations you need for your tree, yard, and wherever else you want to place Santa Claus figurines.
Before my tour, I'd seen a TikTok user post a video that described the decorations as ""tackier"" than usual.
Telsey Group analyst Joe Feldman told me that Target has struggled to stay on trend and in fashion over the past few years.
However, that wasn't my takeaway from this visit.
It had a nostalgic feel, which Gen Zers like myself are obsessed with. That's intentional, Target told me. The ceramic trees and light-up reindeer weren't unlike the decorations my grandma has used for years. Now that I'm decorating my own house, it feels like an opportunity to continue the tradition.
Target said it overhauled its app for the holidays, with the ""Get Ready Yeti"" character who guides guests through what's new on the app, including markdowns and deals.
Target is also pushing Store Mode in the app. The feature displays a virtual map to help shoppers locate what they're looking for in the store. Many other retailer apps have similar features.
Target, like other retailers, is also infusing AI into the shopping experience with a new assistant that can help find the right gift for a loved one. My tour guide demonstrated it by looking up gift ideas for his gothic nephew, who loves video games.
Target also rolled out another AI-powered feature this week, enabling users to take a photo of their written grocery list and have the items added to their cart.
Hearth & Hand with Magnolia is a brand collaboration between Target and home renovation stars Chip Gaines and Joanna Gaines. The brand has its own little holiday setup, and it made me feel like I'd stepped into a small shop selling specialty home goods, such as handmade wreaths and decorative candy canes.
Target-exclusive products were prominently featured in each display during my walkthrough. Both Target-owned and partner brands dominated the shelves, with national brands taking more of a backseat.
Well, sort of. The Target I visited does, in fact, host a weekly event on Saturdays where people can get free cups of hot chocolate. However, the Hot Cocoa Club, where the event is hosted, was still set up with sweet treats, gingerbread houses, and winter-themed plush toys.
Although it was a relatively small part of the store, it smelled of chocolate and mint as we approached. When I got closer, I saw that the cardboard hot chocolate cutout had real steam pumping out from behind it.
The holiday decorations are all fine and dandy, but Target needs more than a booming December quarter to mount a true comeback. Inconsistency in stores has been a frustration for shoppers that the company is working to address.
""Target has to provide a more consistent experience,"" Feldman, the analyst, said, adding that customers expect to have a good experience regardless of the location or number of times they go to the store.
For the retail giant, that means cleaning stores, making sure products are in stock, and offering them at a low price, both Feldman and Sylvester told Business Insider.
Target said Tuesday that it would slash prices on thousands of food and beverage items and household goods in time for Thanksgiving. On my own visit, I observed Black Friday sales stickers already posted in the toys section.
Although Target's new holiday look won't last forever, this level of execution of its plan is necessary to fully turn things around.

21,2025-11-14,"Black Friday used to actually just be one day long. Shoppers would camp outside of stores, paper circulars in hand, eagerly awaiting the chance to bust down some doors and save a ton of cash. Over time, the sales event has grown. Now, the entire month of November is a hydra where the heads are “slashed prices” and the sword-wielding hero is an overwhelmed customer.
Nearly every deal is available online, meaning you don't need to leave the couch to participate. But all the marketing and chaos can get confusing. How can you tell if a deal is worth your time and money? When do sales start and end? Do you really need that gadget? I'm a Black Friday veteran who's been shopping the sales since early childhood and writing about them since 2013, and I'm here to help.
In 2025, Black Friday falls on November 28. It's followed by Cyber Monday on December 1, 2025. Most of the official sales start on Wednesday or Thanksgiving, though some of the best deals start on Friday, sometime in the early hours.
I have been Black Friday shopping for over 20 years. My advice, if you're on the hunt for killer deals, is to stay up late the day before Thanksgiving to check for online sales starting around midnight Eastern time on Wednesday, November 26. WIRED will also cover major sales later in the day on Thanksgiving. Early Black Friday deals are available now, as they usually are during the weeks leading up to the event.
You can—and should. We exclusively cover online deals at WIRED because the majority of Black Friday deals are available on the web. The best deals often sell out quickly, so it's a good idea to pay attention to your favorite store's sale pages (and our coverage).
Make a list of what you want to buy ahead of time—this can help you keep a clear head when it's time to start shopping. You shouldn't buy things just to buy them. Everyone's on a tighter budget these days; sales will happen again. Take a deep breath and don't get sucked into the frenzy.
Nearly all of them. There are obvious stores, like Amazon, Target, Walmart, and Best Buy, but chances are every retailer and brand will have some sort of sale, spanning deals on clothing, shoes, books, electric scooters, tech, health and beauty items, or fitness specialty goods, to name just a few categories. There might even be promotions going on at your favorite coffee shop or restaurant. When in doubt, visit a retailer's website. Usually, Black Friday sales are highlighted proudly on the homepage.
In a word: Usually. Most of the time, Black Friday deals are the best we see all year, and they set the precedent for what dictates a good price in the months that follow.
However, some Black Friday deals aren't all that great or are repetitive from year to year. For instance, you'll predictably see low prices on some smart-home tech, like the Amazon Echo Dot or Google Nest Mini. In previous years, those speakers have sold for around $20 or so, every single November. This year, they'll probably dip to the same price. Even if a price is technically a historic low, consider whether you truly need another cheap little speaker before you place your order—especially considering that these deals tend to pop up repeatedly throughout the year.
Discounts aren't jaw-dropping if the products go on sale every few months, and unfortunately, we have seen more and more repeat sales as the shopping holidays start to blur into one big ball of madness. But the deals are still worth it if you are in the market for a specific item and want to save some cash. Just keep in mind that price research is important, and if you miss out on a deal, don't fret; there's a strong chance it will come around again at some point in the future.
That depends on what you're shopping for. There are so many deals up for grabs in so many categories that it's impossible to list them all here.
For example, TVs are usually a great purchase to make around Black Friday, if you can find the right model. They are at their cheapest this time of year, especially if you don't want to wait until Super Bowl season. In the same vein, you'll be able to save on clothes, toys, and home goods, but those deals may not be as enticing when you look at specific dollar amounts. It's safe to assume that everything is less expensive than usual, though.
The bottom line is that there are deals on just about every sort of item you can think of. If you're diligent about scoring a sale, you can save money on the things you need and want to buy.
Always do your price research. When you're shopping online, take a quick second to look up the item you're considering. You'll be able to see what it's selling for at other stores. In this same vein, it's smart to make a shopping list ahead of time to help avoid impulse buys that'll have you going over your budget, or buying things you don't really want or need just because they're on sale.
Price-checking tools we like to use include Camelcamelcamel, which tracks a product's price over time on Amazon (and has a helpful bookmark tool); Keepa, which displays the price history on the Amazon product page; and Honey, which has price history for other retailers, like Walmart and Best Buy. The latter two tools might slow down your browser a bit, but you can still check them manually if you don't want to install the extensions. You can also check out WIRED's ongoing deals coverage to find roundups of the best discounts available. We only cover items we've actually tested, and we research every price to provide helpful context.
Originally, doorbusters were in-store, exclusive, mouth-wateringly good deals that often required shoppers to arrive early—and sometimes camp out for hours or days—to score them. They were typically available in small quantities and designed to entice shoppers to choose one store over another.
These days, those sorts of in-person doorbuster deals are rare, but similar discounts are available online—with a similar set of restrictions usually applied. If a deal catches your eye and it's marked as a doorbuster, you should be prepared to hit your refresh key at the exact time it starts to avoid missing out.
Here at WIRED, we only cover online deals, and we infrequently cover doorbusters because they're often difficult to nab (though we do have a live blog of deals where we cover such limited-time discounts if they're particularly good). Retailers usually make Black Friday shopping ads available in early November. These circulars are useful when planning, especially for limited deals.
Every Black Friday enthusiast has experienced a deal going out of stock. If you can find out the start time for a deal or sale ahead of time, make sure that you're actively paying attention to the store's website around that time. Navigate to the page and refresh. If the deal is at a retailer you trust, create accounts and save your credit card information before the event begins so the checkout process is as fast as possible. It's also a good idea to clear your web browser cache before you start shopping for Black Friday deals.
If a deal does sell out, there's a good chance another store will have the same deal or one that's similar. That is especially true for big-box stores like Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Best Buy. Check other stores if a deal you want is out of stock. You might find what you're looking for. (Sometimes deals come back in stock as well.) WIRED aims to provide multiple retailer links for each deal for quick access to save you time and potential frustration.
Small Business Saturday arrives immediately after Black Friday. It's all about celebrating smaller local retailers and businesses. The following Monday is Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday deals are usually focused on tech products, like laptops and headphones, but a lot of the major Black Friday deals will still be discounted on Monday. WIRED will cover both events.
The Monday after Cyber Monday is Green Monday. It's less celebrated, but eBay and a few other stores usually have decent sales (it's a last-minute sales event so you can nab a discount before the holidays). After that, there's a break until we get closer to Christmas. Retailers will often hold more last-minute sales, and there's Free Shipping Day on December 14 (though you should try to complete your holiday shopping before that). As the name suggests, many stores will offer free shipping with no minimum purchase.
Outside of the holiday shopping season, popular shopping holidays include Presidents’ Day, Memorial Day, Amazon Prime Day, and Labor Day, among others. WIRED usually covers those events with deal roundups and recommendations too.

24,2025-11-14,"Apple and OpenAI were not able to get a lawsuit filed by Elon Musk's xAI startup dismissed, reports Bloomberg. Texas District Judge Mark Pittman said today that Apple and OpenAI will need to continue on with the lawsuit and submit filings arguing their case.

xAI sued Apple and OpenAI in August 2025, accusing the two companies of conspiring to dominate the AI market. The lawsuit came after Musk complained that his apps X and Grok had not been featured in the App Store's ""Must Have"" apps section.
The lawsuit claimed that Apple was ""blindsided by major innovations in AI,"" leading it to team up with OpenAI in a ""desperate bid to protect its smartphone monopoly."" It referenced Siri's ChatGPT integration, because Apple has not established deals with other companies for ‌Siri‌ integration. xAI said that if iPhone users want to access a generative AI chatbot, ""they have no choice but to use ChatGPT, even if they would prefer to use more innovative and imaginative products like xAI's Grok.""
‌iPhone‌ users can, of course, download any chatbot app from the ‌App Store‌, but xAI said that apps do not have the same ""functionality, usability, and integration"" as ChatGPT does with ‌‌Siri‌‌. The lawsuit also accused Apple of ""deprioritizing"" the apps of competing generative AI chatbots, and depriving Grok of data from billions of ‌iPhone‌ users because Grok isn't integrated with ‌Siri‌ like ChatGPT. The lawsuit claims that xAI ""sought an integration"" with Apple Intelligence, and was denied.
In a filing earlier this month, Apple and OpenAI both argued that the lawsuit is flawed because there is no exclusivity deal that prevents Apple from integrating other chatbots into ‌Siri‌.
xAI has asked the court to put a stop to Apple and OpenAI's ""anticompetitive scheme,"" and help it ""recover billions in damages.""

After months and weeks of waiting, the OnePlus 15 finally went official today (Nov. 13), and while the smartphone is available for order worldwide, it is not yet on sale in the U.S. We now know why this is happening.
Every time a smartphone launches in the U.S., it must be approved by the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) before it can be sold to consumers. This ensures that all radio technologies in the phone, including cellular, Wi Fi, and Bluetooth, comply with FCC regulations.
However, because of the government shutdown in the US, which ended just a day before the OnePlus 15 launched, OnePlus was unable to get the smartphone approved by the FCC. This has caused the delay in releasing the device in the United States.
 



This will not be the case forever, as OnePlus told Android Central that the company has already finished all required tests from FCC-recognized labs and that the certification application has been formally submitted. But with the FCC catching up on over a month of delayed work due to the shutdown, it is hard to say when the OnePlus 15 will actually reach the market.
The company says it hopes the approvals can be generated quickly so it can release the phone in the country. However, for now, if you want to know when the smartphone will be available, you can go to OnePlus.com/us and enter your details, and OnePlus will email you once the phone is ready for purchase.
As for pricing, OnePlus has revealed that the OnePlus 15 will cost $899 in the U.S. whenever it becomes available for the base variant with 12 GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage. This matches the price of the OnePlus 13 in the country, which in itself is pretty interesting given the current tariff situation.

28,2025-11-14,"After weeks of wondering will she, won't she, and recent heavy hints that she would indeed raise income taxes in the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has now decided against the manifesto-breaching move.
Amid the fog of Budget speculation, here is what we do know.
That plan, to raise income tax rates by 2p but compensate workers with a 2p National Insurance cut was sent to the OBR as an option earlier this month to be costed, to help fill what was then a £30bn gap in the public finances, mainly caused by a downgrade to productivity.
The so-called ""2 up, 2 down"" plan, pioneered by the Resolution Foundation think tank, would have raised several billion pounds, mainly from non-wage income such as landlords and savings.
Newer assessments from the OBR appear to have increased the projected strength of wages and tax receipts in the coming years and offset several billion pounds of that gap, taking it closer to £20bn in total.
As a consequence, the plan to raise income tax rates has not been advanced in the latest set of measures sent to the OBR to analyse. 
While this ""iterative"" process is part of the normal forecasting round that precedes a Budget, on Monday of this week the chancellor suggested very strongly that tax rates would go up in a BBC interview. 
Health Secretary Wes Streeting on Friday appeared to confirm the shift away from anything that could be seen to break election promises:
""It is really important that we keep our promises and we stand by our manifesto. The fact that there's been speculation about income tax shows how difficult the situation is with public finances and secondly that the chancellor is determined to stick to her fiscal rules,"" he said.
There is some irony in the health secretary making these comments, given suggestions from Downing St about leadership bids and claims about the unique power of the prime minister and chancellor over the bond markets.
By the end of the week the bond markets were more than nervous as a result of the hokey cokey over income tax.
It is always questionable to assume a singular motive behind the awesome financial power of the debt markets, but let me try to divine what happened over the past 24 hours. 
After the Financial Times' scoop about the dropping of the tax rate plan, there was a notable spike up in the effective borrowing cost for the Government. It was up 0.12% points for a 10-year gilt. 
Markets had been reassured by the tough fiscal talk by the chancellor over the past month. 
Much of this was driven by expectations of lower Bank of England interest rates amid a weakening jobs market. The willingness by the chancellor to take political pain, in the form of breaking tax rate manifesto promises, in order to restrain borrowing in a straightforward way, is a plus for the bond vigilantes. 

But this week's developments, including the dropping of other kites being flown - from extra tax on partnerships, and entrepreneurs leaving the UK -  injected doubt about the appetite to trade political pain for lower bond yields.
Even when it was confirmed that better - or less bad - economic forecasts had helped reduce the budget gap, and create room to avoid the tax rate hike, the markets only calmed briefly, before they crept up to even higher effective rates by the end of the day. The jitters are back.
Insiders said that the chancellor's Budget strategy  ""remains the same"" to increase the buffer or ""headroom"" on meeting her borrowing rules significantly higher from the current £10bn a year,  to tackle cost of living pressures, and to make ""fair choices"" on tax. 
That would appear to mean an extension in the £40bn a year freeze on tax thresholds - which raises an extra £8bn a year as more worker's salaries creep into the higher tax brackets  .
Ministers point to how they are planning to raise tax, as well as the amount, suggesting a squeeze on wealth, capital and income from those sources, rather than long-suffering pay packets.
There are real questions about the loose lips around Whitehall, floating all sorts of significant tax reform, and the impact in markets.
It's worth noting too that final decisions on the Budget have not yet been made, and the process continues. everyone will hope it is smoother from here until the big speech on November 26 .
Some experts think the government may break its promise not to increase income tax, NI or VAT for working people.
Jersey Consumer Council warns a ""user-pays"" tax could lead to unhealthy habits.
Deputy St Pier says increasing income tax places over-reliance on the taxation of personal income.
The Budget somehow has to provide certainty, boost consumer and business confidence, and fill a large fiscal gap.
Scottish ministers wants to use bonds to raise money from investors to fund infrastructure projects.

29,2025-11-14,"There’s a robust ecosystem of Find My accessories on the market nowadays. All of these accessories would make great additions to your life. After all, what’s a better investment than a way to keep track of their most important possessions? 
Last updated November 14, 2025: Added new options from Nomad and Chipolo, updated pricing and availability throughout. 
As a refresher, Find My accessories broadcast a low-energy Bluetooth signal picked up by nearby Apple devices. They do not rely on GPS technology. 
Instead, that location is transmitted securely and privately to the Find My network. This means that your Find My-enabled item is locatable even if you are miles away, so long as someone with an Apple device happens to be nearby.
Apple has consistently rolled out new features to the the Find My network, such as a new system for sharing item locations.
You can’t have a list of the best Find My accessories without including Apple’s AirTags. Packed with a U1 chip for Precision Finding support, a built-in speaker, and more, AirTags are a must-have for attaching to your luggage, backpack, keys, and other accessories.
AirTags have also improved significantly since they were first released in April 2021. Apple has added new anti-stalking features, upgraded notification alerts, and more. You can also now use AirTags with your airline to keep track of your luggage. 
AirTags are not without their faults as they only come in one form factor, lack a built-in attachment mechanism, and are nearly four years old. Still, they represent the best way to start with the Find My ecosystem.
Buy AirTags:
Best AirTags accessories:
While Apple’s AirTag is available in a single form factor, Chipolo makes several different trackers that are fully compatible with Apple’s Find My ecosystem. This means you can add them to the Find My app and track them alongside your Apple products. 
They can also tap into the Find My ecosystem of Apple devices and AirTags to share the most up-to-date location information.
My colleague Benjamin Mayo reviewed the SwitchBot Wallet Finder and described it as an “incredibly useful accessory to track your wallet” using your iPhone and the Find My ecosystem. In addition to being shaped like a credit card to slide into your wallet, it all features a built-in keyring holder. This makes it easy to attach to something like a lanyard or backpack.
Buy the SwitchBot Wallet Finder:
Another popular brand for Find My accessories is Pebblebee. 
The Pebblebee Clip is a small tracker that is similar to the AirTag form factor but with a built-in keyring holder. It features up to 12 months of battery life and can then be recharged using a USB-C cable.
Finally, there’s the Pebblebee Tracker Universal Tag with Find My integration. This offers an ultra-small form factor with up to 8 months of battery life and a USB-C port for charging.
While I generally recommend buying a standalone Find My tracker, there are backpacks on the market that directly integrate Find My. The primary offering on the market right now comes from Swissdigital. 
If you’re a traveler, Twelve South has one of the more interesting implementations of Find My that I’ve seen. The Twelve South PlugBug is a USB-C fast-charging brick that integrates with Find My. This means you’ll never lose your charger again. It’s become a staple of my backpack gear. 
The Twelve South PlugBug is available in two different versions and can be ordered on Amazon. 
Nomad’s new Find My Tracking Card Pro packs an ultra-premium metal design that actually looks like a credit card. Is it overkill? Yes. Do I think it looks incredibly cool? Also yes. 
It features full Find My integration, so you never have to worry about losing or misplacing your wallet. Nomad’s card is meant to slide right into your wallet and disguise itself among your other cards. 
Tracking Card Pro wirelessly recharges on any Qi or MagSafe charger and lasts up to 16 months on a single charge. 
Nomad also sells a Tracking Card Carbide, which is less impressive in terms of design but cheaper. It also charges wirelessly. 
While the accessories mentioned above are my top picks, there are other Find My-enabled options on the market.
What are your favorite Find My accessories? Let us know down in the comments.

Samsung phones in global markets have the Device Care menu, which is a one-stop hub for maintaining your phone. However, Chinese users have the Smart Manager app, and it will receive some new features as part of the upcoming One UI 8.5 update.
GalaxyTechie on Twitter (h/t: SammyGuru) spotted these Smart Manager additions and highlighted them. Some of the most notable new features include native app lock functionality, app state restoration, and sleep standby optimization.
Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority?
Native app lock functionality (seen in the first two screenshots below) is a great alternative to the current app lock solution on Galaxy phones. Samsung owners in global markets have to add their apps to Secure Folder if they want to lock them. However, Secure Folder effectively creates a cloned version of the app, while another instance of the app remains visible and accessible in the main app drawer unless you hide it. By contrast, the Smart Manager app lets you lock and unlock apps directly on the home screen using a pattern/PIN/password or biometrics. One of the screenshots also suggests that you can lock entire folders on the home screen.
Meanwhile, app state restoration (see the third screenshot above) lets you restore your app to its previous state before a crash or freeze. It’s unclear how this will work, while Samsung’s fine print cautions that it might not work for all apps. Nevertheless, I hope this means the app will save your work-in-progress message or keep your place in your social media home feed.
The Smart Manager app also offers a sleep standby optimization feature, which lets you squeeze more battery life out of your phone by limiting performance while you sleep. These optimizations can kick in based on your sleep patterns or according to a set time period each day.
These aren’t the only tweaks and additions spotted by GalaxyTechie. The app also has a new storage management menu, a background control page for tweaking how apps run in the background, and a keep apps active toggle that lets you tweak when specific apps can run in the background. Toss in a privacy lockdown option and live notification/Now Bar support, and it’s a pretty significant upgrade for Galaxy owners in China.
The tipster notes that only users with rooted Galaxy devices can install the Smart Manager app. So I really hope these features and tweaks are ported to the Device Care menu on global phones.

Whether youâre looking to upgrade your existing PC setup or want to start fresh with a reliable desktop, Amazon is making the jump easy. You can grab the HP ProDesk 600 G6 SFF desktop tower PC for just $649 right now, which is a massive 68% off its regular price.
This is the lowest weâve seen this configuration go for, and youâre even getting Windows 11 Pro, a wired keyboard, a wireless adapter, and a mouse for absolutely free. Just note that discounts this massive tend to wrap up fast, so itâs better to grab it as soon as you can. Weâre not sure if the offer will be back for Black Friday, or if the stock will last till then.
See at Amazon
The PC runs on a 6-core Intel i5-10400 processor. It comes with 12 threads and a max turbo speed of 4.3GHz, which translates into an overall better performance for all your work tasks, school assignments, and even casual use. Thereâs Intel UHD Graphics 630 to take care of the visuals, which holds up well for everyday computing across dual displays.
Most of us need to use multiple applications and tabs at the same time to get through our busy days. To make that easy, HP has packed this PC with 32GB of DDR4 RAM, which does a great job of keeping things snappy. You can multitask all you want and even push some creative limits without slowing down one bit.
Then youâve also got a 1TB PCIe SSD to store all that you own locally. Think plenty of high-resolution photos, videos, backups, programs, and even games; all in a single place. Even with all this, youâre likely going to still have space left over, and since it’s a PCIe SSD, everything loads significantly faster than what you’d get with a traditional hard drive. The system will boot much faster, and file transfers wonât take hours either.
Connectivity options include USB-C, multiple USB-A ports (10Gbps, 5Gbps, and 480Mbps), two DisplayPort 1.4 outputs, an RJ-45 Ethernet port, a front headphone/mic combo jack, and a USB Wi-Fi adapter for wireless access.
Getting Windows 11 Pro pre-installed means you wonât have to worry about any complicated installation procedures or subscription costs to get started. Just take the PC out of the box, plug it in, connect your monitor, and youâre good to go.

32,2025-11-14,"Google wants to put visual content front-and-center in its Search app. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.
The Google app on iOS and Android has become a versatile home for web searches, AI features, and image browsing. Now, Google is updating the app on iOS and Android to add a dedicated tab for visual content called Images. Following prior tests, the Google app is gaining a Discover-style hub for photos and graphics in the U.S. starting this week.
The company explains in a blog post that despite Google Images' popularity, users find it hard to describe exactly what they're looking for. That's where the Images tab in the Google app comes into play. It'll show users new images daily based on their interests, and the algorithm will adjust over time as interests evolve.
""We’re making that inspiration even easier to find with a new way to discover visual content in the Google app,"" Google says.
That sounds like a mix of Google Discover, which curates news and entertainment content based on your interests, or social sites like Pinterest. Google calls the Images tab ""a new way to explore and organize images in the Google app."" It's located at the bottom of the Google app homepage, next to the Home, Search, Notifications, and Activity tabs.
 



After discovering visual content in the Images tab, users can save it to their collections in the Google app. You can also use images you find to search for new ones. It's sorted based on topic, with a general ""For you"" roundup in the Images tab beside personalized topic pages based on your interests and activity.
You can try out the Images tab in the Google app starting now, and it's going to be rolling out further over the coming weeks to all iOS and Android users.
 



The Images tab is the latest in a flurry of Google app updates rolling out as the holiday season approaches. Earlier this week, Google updated AI Mode to be your personal shopping helper, supporting natural language conversations about the products users want to buy. It can scan product information, buyer reviews, and even check if something is in-stock at a store near you on your behalf.

What this means: On a weekly basis, Realtor.com reports the year-over-year change in active inventory, new listings and median prices.  On a monthly basis, they report total inventory.  For October, Realtor.com reported active inventory was up 15.3% YoY, but still down 13.2% compared to the 2017 to 2019 same month levels. 
Here is their weekly report: Weekly Housing Trends: Latest Data as of Nov. 8• Active inventory climbed 12.8% year over year

The number of homes active on the market climbed 12.8% year-over-year, as the streak of annual gains stretched past two years in length. There were about 1.1 million homes for sale last week, marking the 28th week in a row over the million-listing threshold. Active inventory is growing due to both new listings hitting the market and listings taking longer to sell in this weak 2025 sales year.
  
• New listings—a measure of sellers putting homes up for sale—rose 10.5% year over year

New listings were up 10.5% last week compared with the same period a year ago. New listing growth has ping-ponged in recent weeks as we enter the slowest period of the year for selling homes. Take this double-digit improvement with a grain of salt, as it marks an improvement over an already-low figure from last year. However, if we do continue to see more new listings coming onto the market, it could be due to mortgage rates hovering in the low-6% range and enticing homeowners to make a move.
  
• The median listing price fell 1.0% year-over-year

The median list price dropped compared to the same week one year ago. Adjusting for home size, price per square foot fell 1.1% year-over-year, dropping for the tenth consecutive week. Price per square foot grew steadily for almost two years, but the weak sales activity has finally caught up and shaken underlying home values despite stable prices.

36,2025-11-14,"BGR has been checking inventory for the iPhone 17 series every Friday since the four new handsets went on sale online. We started on the first preorder day, September 12, and more than two months later, our findings show iPhone 17 stock is still constrained in various markets, especially in North America. We've been tracking the same countries every week, using the shipping delays Apple's local online stores provide to gauge demand. Over the past few months, we've noticed a few trends, including unexpected ones.
For example, the iPhone 17 Pro Max was consistently sold out. It was the first model to go out of stock on the initial day of preorders. More surprising is that the base iPhone 17 model, which sold out over the first preorder weekend, has remained sold out in key markets like the U.S. since then. Also surprising is that the base iPhone 17 Pro is now in stock in all the markets we've been tracking, as you'll see below. The handset was in stock last week as well. Finally, the iPhone Air has rarely shown any shipping delay estimates online. China was a notable example last month, but the ultra-thin handset only started selling in the country in mid-October, after Apple passed local regulatory clearances.
What's interesting this week is that iPhone 17 stock has improved in the U.S., where it faced more severe supply constraints in the past few weeks. At the same time, certain European markets are seeing renewed shipping delays compared to last week. In either case, the base iPhone 17 model has longer wait times than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, which is a notable development for Apple's cheapest iPhone model.
Every week, we perform the same standard stock check on Apple.com. We access the local online store for the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, China, and Japan, and we simulate buying all the possible iPhone storage and color combinations for each market. The store immediately provides shipping delay estimates for the models that are out of stock. Here's what this week's delivery estimates are for these countries:
The data above suggests that consumers who have not purchased an iPhone 17 version can get one immediately or have it delivered within two weeks. It's likely that other international markets that we have not tracked every week may experience similar iPhone 17 stock issues. Anyone looking to make sure they can purchase one of the four new iPhones in time for Christmas should have no problem securing it. The iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro are available immediately online in the markets above. They're probably available in local Apple retail stores as well.
That said, it's unclear how much stock Apple has on hand for any given market. Shipping times can slip once Apple runs out of inventory, as happened with Germany and Switzerland this week. They can also improve from day to day. For example, shipping times for the base iPhone 17 have slightly improved in the U.S. compared to last week."

39,2025-11-14,"Stephen Curry and Under Armour are officially breaking up.
The NBA star with the Golden State Warriors and the sportswear company said in a statement on Thursday that they have mutually agreed to end their 13-year partnership, separating Curry from Under Armour as the retailer undergoes a broader restructuring.
According to the press release, Under Armour will still release the Curry 13 shoes in February, but that will be the final sneaker produced under their collaboration.
""For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround,"" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement. ""And for Stephen, it's the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms.""
A person with knowledge of the separation told Business Insider that the Curry brand can look for new partners and investment.
The brand has been struggling with declining sales for the past eight quarters, executive turnover, and a restructuring plan that the company estimates to cost $255 million. That figure now includes costs associated with separating from the Curry brand.
The collaboration with Curry is expected to bring in at least $100 million in revenue over the current fiscal year for Under Armour, but the company said in the press release that the separation won't have a ""significant effect"" on the company's profitability.
On Thursday, Jefferies analysts, led by Randal Konik and Corey Tarlowe, said Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was ""getting back to the basics"" with the Curry split.
""Parting ways with Curry makes so much sense. He's a great athlete, but we always questioned his marketability and believed the Curry shoes and apparel products never resonated with a wide audience,"" the note said.
They added, ""With Curry gone and new CFO on the way, we think UAA is positioning itself for an eventual turn.""
Under Armour stock was down 2% on Thursday. It's down nearly 50% in the past year.
Curry first joined Under Armour in 2013, after choosing the significantly smaller ""underdog"" brand over Nike to collaborate in creating sneakers. The Curry Brand then debuted in 2020, and by 2023, inked a long-term extension that made Curry its president while remaining under Under Armour's umbrella. As part of that deal, the 11-time All-Star winner received 8.8 million Under Armour shares that were worth about $75 million at the time, alongside additional awards and incentives.

Google has dropped a package of concessions aimed at resolving a major antitrust fight with the EU, hoping to settle the dispute without breaking up its business.
This follows the European Commission’s decision in September to fine Google €2.95 billion ($3.4 billion) for what regulators describe as anti-competitive behavior in online advertising. Regulators say Google used its position as both a vendor and a platform to promote its own tools and limit opportunities for competitors and publishers.
Google does not dispute the fine itself, but disagrees with the Commission’s assessment. The company says it is submitting a plan to comply while keeping its business intact.
Rather than selling parts of its ad-tech business, Google says its plan will let publishers set different minimum bids for different bidders in its Ad Manager platform and improve how Google’s ad tools work with competing services. This means publishers and advertisers would have more flexibility to use options outside of Google.
The company states it wants to meet the EC’s demands without a disruptive breakup that would “harm the thousands of European publishers and advertisers who use Google tools to grow their business.”
However, the EC has flagged that the kind of conflict Google is accused of often requires structural change to truly level the playing field. That means while Google’s proposals are on the table, the regulator is still assessing whether they’ll actually bring an end to the alleged self-preferencing and vertical conflicts in the tech giant’s ad-tech supply chain.
Google's ad-tech business also faced the same legal dilemma in the U.S. after U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled earlier this year that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, violated antitrust laws for advertisements.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
This is a huge deal for advertisers and publishers in Europe. Google’s ad-tech system is key to how they reach audiences and earn revenue. If Google reduces its control as promised, the way bidding works, prices, and how tools connect could all change significantly.
On the other hand, if structural changes are accepted, it could set an example for how ad tech is regulated worldwide. The EC has made it clear that this issue is not just about fines, but also about market structure, fairness, and future competition.

Nvidia is navigating some growing pains as its enterprise software sales team onboards massive clients in highly regulated industries.
Nvidia has been hitting astronomic highs amid the AI boom and even became the first $5 trillion market cap company last month.
At the same time, internal emails sent this summer by senior sales employees in its Worldwide Field Operations — which works with customers to deploy its technology — reveal it's contending with some hurdles as it tries to tell clients a ""comprehensive software story"" and sell those products alongside its highly sought-after AI hardware.
""Everyone is hacking their own decks together and we need to come up with one company message,"" one of the emails said.
The emails refer to sales of Nvidia AI Enterprise (NVAIE) and other software products, including Run:ai, which helps companies manage GPUs; Omniverse, a platform for simulating 3D worlds; and vGPU, which enables multiple workers to share GPUs.
Nvidia AI Enterprise is a suite of tools that helps clients make their own AI apps. It was launched in 2021 and designed to run with Nvidia's AI chips and CUDA, a Nvidia software package that allows the chips to handle a wide range of computing tasks. NVAIE's customer list includes Nasdaq, the IRS, and AT&T.
These internal discussions focus on the sale of those Nvidia business software products — not CUDA.
Nvidia declined to comment.
Nvidia specializes in designing GPUs and other AI hardware, which is the company's main business, and it doesn't break out revenues for business software in earnings reports.
While software is a smaller part of its business, it helps the company generate recurring revenue for a wider range of AI products across both hardware and software and deepen customer dependence.
Despite some hiccups, Nvidia is forecasting healthy software sales.
One internal email, sent in July, features a sales chart for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 in North and Latin America that shows stand-alone software is projected to hit 110% of sales targets. Software sold alongside hardware was expected to reach only 39% of its goal.
Overall, software sales forecasts were $78.7 million for the quarter, driven by NVAIE, which was forecast to hit 186% of the target.
The July email states Nvidia's sales partners and account managers need to develop a ""comprehensive software story"" around NVAIE and other software products. It mentions plans to create a workshop for customers to use NVAIE and other product libraries to plan potential AI ventures.
An email in August detailed the need for additional education — both internally and when negotiating with clients.
""Biggest pain point will be educating [a prospective client's] procurement and legal teams on what our AI Enterprise software is/isn't,"" the August email reads.
That email also says there is a ""fundamental disconnect"" between Nvidia and clients' legal and procurement teams in understanding Nvidia's software sales processes during negotiations — ""particularly within highly regulated industries,"" such as finance and healthcare.
Data security and indemnity obligations, which are Nvidia's legal responsibility in the event that a client is sued, were other sticking points in negotiations, according to the August email.
Other concerns included requesting higher damages caps — the maximum amount that Nvidia would have to pay if something goes wrong — than Nvidia is comfortable with.
Nvidia is far from alone in contending with uneven AI adoption, as some companies view the white-hot technology as too early to deploy widely, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report.

With holiday sales starting early, photographers have a rare chance to stock up on fast, reliable memory cards from top brands, many at the lowest prices of the year.

If you’ve been waiting for the right time to pick up an iPad, that time is now. Apple just kicked off most of its Black Friday deals on Amazon and spans everything from iPads and MacBooks to Apple Watches and AirTags. But perhaps the star of the show is the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip (WiFi + 128GB) which is now down to $299 from its original $349 sticker price. This model launched in early 2025 and quickly became the best-selling tablet on the market so to see it drop to an all-time low this quickly almost feels too good to be true.
See at Amazon
Apple redesigned this iPad to handle the kind of multitasking most of us throw at our devices daily. The A16 chip powers through photo editing, gaming and streaming without hesitation. You get 128GB of storage right out of the gate and gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and documents before you even think about cloud storage.
It’s an 11-inch Liquid Retina display that brings colors to life in such a way that streaming movies or editing photos becomes genuinely enjoyable. True Tone technology changes the color temperature of the screen with respect to your surroundings, so you are not squinting at a harsh blue glow by night or straining to see details by bright sunlight. This may sound minor until you realize how much easier it makes long reading sessions or late-night work sessions go on your eyes. The screen hits that sweet spot where it’s large enough for serious work but compact enough to toss in a bag without thinking twice.
Wi-Fi 6 connectivity keeps you moving at full speed when you’re downloading files, uploading content, or jumping between video calls. The USB-C connector finally standardized charging and data transfer, meaning you can use the same cable for your iPad that you use for most of your other devices. There are 12MP cameras on both the front and back of the device, giving you solid options for video calls, document scanning, or just quick photos when you don’t have your phone handy. An important addition is Center Stage, a technology in the front camera that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls.
Touch ID built into the top button gives you quick access without typing passwords constantly. You unlock the iPad, sign into apps, and authorize Apple Pay transactions with just your fingerprint. The iPadOS uses hardware to full capacity, and allows you to run multiple apps side by side, use the Scribble to handwrite in any text field with an Apple Pencil, and organize your workflow in ways that actually make sense.
For $299, this iPad offers good value to anyone who needs a capable tablet that can handle real work without compromise.

46,2025-11-14,"Last month, during Apple’s Q4 2025 earnings call, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the company “couldn’t be more pleased” with the reception of the iPhone 17 lineup in China. Now, Counterpoint Research has a few numbers on that.
While Apple typically doesn’t disclose sales numbers and is usually very coy when commenting on sales performance in specific countries or regions, Cook sounded particularly confident when discussing how the iPhone 17 family was doing in China, following a rather extended period of slumping sales in the country:
Ben Reitzes (Mellius Research): Can you talk a little bit about iPhone in China? Specifically, how is that going to trend in the December quarter? And have you turned the corner there? And how do you think that trajectory is going?
Tim Cook: Yeah, Ben, (…) The iPhone 17 family has been very well received there. We do believe that we will return to growth in Q1 and that is largely based on the reception of the iPhone there. And so, I couldn’t be more pleased with how things are going there in the early going.
Later during that same call, when pressed on a “muted” performance in China for the quarter, Cook insisted that it wasn’t due to lack of interest, but rather due to supply constraints. He added:
“We are thrilled with what we’re seeing right now with traffic being up significantly year-over-year, and the reception of the [iPhone] 17 family. We expect to return to growth this quarter.”
Finally, Cook also added later on that although recent government subsidies helped Apple pick up sales in China, “several of our products (…) are not eligible for a subsidy,” since it only applies within a specific price range, meaning that the demand for the new iPhones stood on its own.
Now, Counterpoint Research is out with a report that adds some numbers to Cook’s optimism.
As reported by Reuters:
Sales of iPhones in China rose 22% from year-earlier levels in the first month after the iPhone 17 series launched, even as the broader market softened, a private survey showed on Friday.
The new lineup drove most of Apple’s smartphone sales in China in the period from the September 19 launch, with the 17 series accounting for nearly four-fifths of units sold to consumers, according to the data from research firm Counterpoint.
Reuters also noted that, according to the same report, iPhone sales in China declined by 5% in the month following the launch of the iPhone 16 last year. That makes this year’s 22% jump even more noteworthy, particularly considering that the broader Chinese smartphone market reportedly slipped 2.7% year-over-year during the same period.

Nvidia and Tesla headlined broader gains across tech stocks on Friday afternoon, leading a rebound for major indexes a day after markets posted their worst declines in more than a month. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped roughly 100 points (0.2%), while the S&P 500 rose 0.4% and the Nasdaq added 0.7% as of Friday afternoon, after each index fell more than 1% earlier in the day and dropped 1.6%, 1.6% and 2.2% on Thursday, respectively, in their largest single-day losses since October.
Stocks recovered on Friday following a widespread rout on Thursday, during which investors dumped AI stocks amid general economic uncertainty, after the U.S. ended the longest government shutdown in history, with added concerns the Federal Reserve may not lower interest rates next month.
Markets also appeared to react to the White House announcing that employment and inflation data for October and September would be at least partially released, after previously the data would “likely never” be published, as economists projected inflation to remain high while the labor market likely deteriorated further.
Nvidia rose 1.5% to around $189, adding to a 1.6% increase for Tesla, after both megacap stocks slumped 0.4% and 2.4% earlier in the day, respectively.
Other stocks turned positive by Friday afternoon, including AMD (up 1.5%), Palantir (1.9%), Broadcom (0.9%), Apple (0.8%), Microsoft (1.1%) and Intel (0.1%), among others, while Amazon (down 0.3%) and Alphabet (0.4%) remained in the negative.
UnitedHealth Group headlined losses across the Dow as shares traded down 3%, followed by Nike (2.5%), American Express (1.7%) and Walt Disney (1.7%).
The cryptocurrency market was also hit by a selloff, with the price of bitcoin dropping below $96,000 for the first time in six months before paring back earlier losses. The world’s most valuable cryptocurrency is down more than 6% over the past 24 hours, falling to around $96,031 after earlier falling to as low as $94,592, the lowest level for the leading cryptocurrency since May. Ether, the token with the second-largest market cap, dropped to $3,130, down more than 10.3% over the past 24 hours. Other major cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Solana’s SOL and Binance’s BNB, are down 8.8%, 10.5% and 6.2% respectively. Crypto-linked stocks similarly declined, including Strategy (down 3.9%) and Coinbase (1.3%). It appears the broader crypto market is reeling from traders lowering odds of an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month, as key economic data remains delayed, leading to investors pressuring riskier assets, according to Bloomberg. Liquidity has also plummeted: Exchange-traded funds investing in bitcoin reported new outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest withdrawal since they were introduced in January 2024, according to CoinGlass"

57,2025-11-14,"Apple and Richard Plelper’s EDEN Productions are teaming up once again to turn investigative podcast Hot Money: The New Narcos into an Apple TV show. Here are the details.
Deadline reports that Apple is in the early development stages of an Apple TV series based on Hot Money: The New Narcos, an investigative podcast co-hosted by Miles Johnson, of the Financial Times.
The eight-episode podcast premiered in late 2023, and told the story of a cocaine “super cartel” that operated like a multinational corporation. Here’s the podcast’s original description:
“A middle-aged electrician is murdered in a quiet Amsterdam suburb. The case leads to a web of drugs, money laundering and state-sponsored assassinations that stretches from Dublin to Dubai. At the center is a cocaine super cartel that is revolutionising the global drugs market. Financial Times investigative reporter Miles Johnson exposes the ever-fuzzier line between criminals and legitimate business people and between governments and gangsters.”
The podcast was investigated and co-hosted by Johnson, who will also serve as an executive producer on the new show, alongside the Financial Times and audio production studio Pushkin.
For now, there’s no timeline for when the show will premiere.
Apple TV is available for $12.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Severance, The Studio, The Morning Show, Shrinking and Silo.

After one investor called his startup idea the ""worst,"" a cofounder leaned hard on influencers to grow his AI-powered presentation business.
Now, Gamma is a $2.1 billion company — and a growth engine fueled by thousands of ""micro-influencers.""
Gamma cofounder Grant Lee said on an episode of ""Lenny's Podcast"" published Thursday that in the company's early days, he personally onboarded every influencer. He saw it as valuable time spent because they would understand Gamma's product and help the brand grow authentically.
""You want to be able to have them tell your story, but in their voice,"" he said. ""They can't do that if you're not willing to put in that investment,"" he added.
Lee said the key to influencer marketing wasn't about finding influencers with a few million followers. It was about working with ""micro influencers,"" people without massive followings but who are ""committed to giving value to their audiences.""
""People really trust what they say,"" Lee said. ""That ends up becoming this wildfire that can spread really, really fast.""
Lee said he would onboard these influencers by walking them through the product, brainstorming content angles, and giving feedback without being ""super prescriptive.""
""You want them to be an extension of your team, and I think they can feel whether or not you're willing to put in the work,"" he said.
""They want to be able to showcase tools that actually they would use or they are using,"" he added.
Lee said investing in those relationships has reaped benefits, such as influencers coming back to post about the company. ""That's really where the magic is,"" he said.
Word-of-mouth — which accounts for over 50% of Gamma's subscriber growth — remains the company's biggest growth driver. Influencers helped to boost word-of-mouth, Lee said.
On Monday, Gamma announced a $68 million Series B round at a $2.1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz.
Lee said in an X post Monday that Gamma has reached $100 million in annual recurring revenue and 70 million users. The company was founded in 2020 and launched its first product in 2022.
Gamma last raised $12 million in Series A led by Accel in 2024.
Some AI startups are also leveraging influencers to accelerate their growth.
The cofounder of AI ""cheating"" app Cluely, Chungin ""Roy"" Lee, said in an episode of the ""Sourcery"" podcast published in June that he is betting big on influencers to drive product growth.
""You're either building the product or you're making the product go viral,"" Lee said on the podcast, describing job scopes at Cluely.
He told TechCrunch last month that startups need to scale up their distribution. Most startups fail because they are not visible, even if they have product-market fit, he said.
Lee told Business Insider earlier this year that his main goal for Cluely is to reach 1 billion views across all platforms.
The broader influencer-marketing industry has also benefited from collaborating with companies. Business Insider reported last year that influencer marketing remained strong in 2024, with firms seeing rising deal volume and spending.
Brands are ""shifting from one-time, short-term partnerships to long-term, recurring partnerships,"" Olivia McNaughten, senior director of product marketing and partnerships at the influencer firm Grin, told Business Insider.
Fohr, another influencer-marketing firm, told Business Insider it saw a 36% year-over-year jump in deal volume and a 47% increase in total dollars for those deals in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period a year earlier.

The threat of AI has sent shockwaves through the software sector, hammering share prices and creating, in the words of analysts at RBC Capital Markets, a rare opportunity for ""opportunistic"" buyers.
Once-high-flying software companies are now trading at deep discounts as investors worry about how generative AI could upend SaaS business models. That same anxiety, the analysts argue, is laying the groundwork for a new wave of dealmaking.
According to RBC, software M&A activity has surged 78% this year, with private-equity deal volume more than doubling as sponsors hunt for bargains.
""We continue to see software underperform on concerns around AI and as this underperformance drags on in spite of better-than-expected results, we may see more buyers opportunistically step in and take advantage of dislocations, particularly in private equity,"" the analysts wrote in a recent note to investors.
While noting they have no knowledge of any such deals, the analysts listed potential targets, all of which have solid customer bases and cash flow but limited AI narratives. Private-equity buyers, less constrained by quarterly earnings pressure, could move quickly to take these companies private, reset expectations, and rebuild them for an AI-first world.
While regulatory scrutiny remains a hurdle for mega-cap tech acquirers, financial sponsors are freer to strike. RBC expects deal momentum to accelerate as sentiment stabilizes and valuations remain depressed. For investors, the AI scare that crushed software stocks might soon become the catalyst for a new consolidation boom, one driven not by hype, but by hard-nosed value hunting.
Here's RBC's view on which software companies are potential mergers and acquisitions targets and why:

            / CBS News
          
Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring on expectations of runaway growth. 
But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust. 
The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.
Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth. 
Thursday's stock market tumble — when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months — fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.
Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.
""The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,"" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News. 
In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500  is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called ""Magnificent 7"" — Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar. 
That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.
""No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,"" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.  
Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio — a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits — found it is ""roughly half"" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.
""So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,"" they noted. 
The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.
""This is different in the sense that these companies — the companies that are so highly valued — actually have earnings and stuff like that,"" Powell said. ""So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.""
Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%. 
Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution. 
For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.
""We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,"" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.
For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a ""4th industrial revolution"" that could supercharge economic growth. ""This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,"" he wrote this week in a research note. 
""The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,"" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.

Black Friday deals are slashing prices across a range of categories, which also makes it a great time to invest in outdoor upgrades. If youâre looking for a more fun and sustainable way of getting around the town, an e-bike can be an excellent investment.
As youâd expect, the top options out there donât come in cheap. On a regular day, youâre looking at spending well over $2,000 for a reliable e-bike. But thanks to Upwayâs Black Friday event, thatâs not the case today. The platform is offering up to an extra $1,000 off select e-bikes, and thatâs on top of existing discounts that already go as high as 60% off retail. There are multiple brands, plus a ton of options to choose from, whether youâre looking for something beginner-friendly or a bit on the advanced side.
See at Upway
Upway is the number one site in the U.S. for buying and selling e-bikes. You also get a 1-year warranty for added peace of mind. On the website, you can filter your search by brand, e-bike type, and even browse options to match your budget.
The platform sources only the best electric bike brands in the world from collaborations with manufacturers, bike shops, and individuals. Each bike undergoes a 50-point inspection to make sure thereâs no structural or mechanical damage, and that the drive system, battery, plus accessories work like new. Any worn parts, like the tires or seats, are replaced. Even better, if the batteryâs residual capacity is below 80% of its original value, itâs replaced as well. Every bike then goes through a final inspection and quality check before itâs listed and shipped to its new home. If youâre not vibing with your new bike, Upway has you covered with its 14-day money-back guarantee.
Some of our top picks from the sale? The Ghost E-Square Trekking Essential is now $1,049 after an extra $600 off. The Felt Verza-E 30 S is down to $1,099 with an extra $200 off. And if youâre looking for something more affordable, the Karmic Koben is going for just $699 after a $250 discount.
Thereâs a lot more to browse, but the discounts (or the stock) are likely not going to stick around for long. If you see something you like, itâs best to grab it sooner rather than later.

Google AI Online services

The AI revolution shows no signs of slowing down, and today Google is announcing some new features that, only a few short years ago, would have sounded like Sci-Fi.
First, Google's agentic AI can now call stores on your behalf to ask what's in stock. This is available when you search for certain products near you in Google Search. When you see the ""Let Google call"" option, tap ""get started"" and you'll get a few questions tailored to what you're shopping for.
Google's AI then calls stores nearby to see if they have what you're looking for in stock, how much it costs, and if there are any special offers. You'll receive an email or text with the answers, and local inventory from other nearby stores. This is now rolling out to Search categories like toys, health and beauty, and electronics, in the US.
Google's AI can now also buy things for you thanks to agentic checkout. If you track an item's price in Google Search, you can  select the exact item you want, including size, color, and amount you want to spend, and you'll get a notification when the price reaches your budget. Then you can have Google buy the item for you using Google Pay.
This only works with eligible merchants and Google will ask your permission first, and will only buy after you've confirmed that you want the purchase to be made. Agentic checkout is now rolling out in Search, including in AI Mode, in the US.
Speaking of AI Mode, this now lets you ""describe what you're looking for just as you'd say it to a friend"" and then gives you an intelligently organized response with rich visuals and important details like price, reviews, and inventory info. AI Mode responses are ""tailored to your specific question and formatted for your needs"", Google says.
Finally, you can now use shopping features in the Gemini app in the US. Gemini will help you with ideas for holiday shopping, offering ""helpful shopping ideas"", ""shoppable product listings, comparison tables, prices from across the web and places to buy"", all inside the Gemini app.

Other commenter already said you're super optimistic. 
I say it goes in the other direction buddy. Our government wants to buy AI for all their citizens. :)
No, thanks... I hope for this and many other big corpos to be fully destroyed
This is incredible!  Google knows so much about you that it will just shop for you.  Man, how convenient!  Who knew I liked all these Google third party vendor products!?

71,2025-11-14,"With the M21, Fiio may have delivered its best digital audio player yet, and it's affordability is a key selling point. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

After a year and a half of regular use, Fiio's M23 audio player is still going strong. What I enjoy the most about the M23 is the power and neutral sound — it basically allows IEMs and connected headsets to shine, and it lets me access to my favorite music platforms, including Roon.
Coming in at $719, the M23 is solidly in the mid-range, so when Fiio said it was rolling out a new model that's much more affordable, I was interested. The M21 has a smaller 4.7-inch panel and 4,000mAh battery, but it lasts longer, and it comes with Android 13, which in itself is a big deal as most other audio players I'm using are still on Android 10 or Android 12.
 



What's notable is that the M21 costs $329 on Amazon, making it that much easier to recommend. Oh, and did I mention it has 950mW of power at 32Ω? That's unheard of in this category. Finally, Fiio has a delightful cassette case aimed at the M21; the case makes the audio player look like a cassette player — much like the Fiio CP13 — and this is easily one of my favorite Fiio accessories.
 



With that out of the way, let's get to the design. The M21 has a distinctly different feel to it than other Fiio players, and I like the new aesthetic quite a bit. The rear of the device has a frosted glass finish, and it makes holding and using it that much more comfortable. If anything, it feels closer to a phone-like finish, and I like it a lot.
 



Another positive is that the finish prevents smudges and micro-scratches, and this is a big deal — my M23 constantly needs cleaning, and I just didn't have to bother doing that with the M21. The smaller size also makes a difference in usability, and at 193g, the M21 isn't anywhere as heavy as the M23 or even the M15S. That's a good thing considering it is made out of aluminum, and the build quality is just as great as Fiio's high-end players.
 



The 4.7-inch 720p resolution is decent enough, and while it doesn't come close to what you get on most phones these days, it is entirely serviceable. The audio player gets the power button and volume rocker on the left alongside the multifunction button, and they have good tactility. The playback controls are on the right, and again, they have good feedback.
 



I like that the buttons are accented in gold; this differentiates the design a little bit, providing a nice contrast to the blue hue of the device itself. The M21 gets a single-ended 3.5mm port alongside a balance 4.4mm out, and you get USB-C connectivity in addition to a dedicated USB-C port that solely draws power. This is useful because the M21 has a desktop mode, allowing you to bypass its internal battery and solely use USB power.

This ensures the battery isn't affected when using the M21 in desktop mode, and I'm glad to see this mode available on what is ostensibly a budget player. Rounding out the connectivity, you get a MicroSD slot. The M21 also gets pogo connectors on the rear, and these are used to pair it with the unique cassette case.
 



The cassette case is much better than the usual leather cases that Fiio has with its digital audio players. I get why it isn't bundled, but if you're interested in the M21 and are hankering for a bit of nostalgia, I highly recommend getting the cassette case. It not only provides much-needed protection, but you also get physical controls — you can change music playback controls and adjust volume, with the case connecting to the M21 via magnetic pogo connectors.
 



In fact, in this mode, the M21 solely relies on physical controls, and it turns the device into a cassette player, and it's just plain cool. I'll admit that I used this mode a lot more than I initially imagined, and the novelty doesn't really go away. The case itself is made out of plastic, but build quality is decent, and I haven't had any issues with it. The only quibble is that when you slot the M21 in the case, you lose access to the buttons on the left side of the device.
 



Switching over to the software, the M21 comes with Android 13 out of the box, and you get full access to the Play Store. Fiio has its own app market that lets you install all mainstream music platforms, and like the M23, the M21 ties in nicely with Roon. You also get Tidal, Spotify, Qobuz, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and just about any other music service you need.
 



The M21 is powered by the Snapdragon 680, and it gets 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage. On the music side of things, it has a quartet of Cirrus Logic CS43198 DAC chips, and a custom TI OPA1692 alongside SG Micro SGM8262-2 amps. It also includes a Bluetooth 5.0 modem with the entire AptX suite.
 



The UI is plain Android, and the interface is a little faster than even the M23. You can easily slot in a 2TB MicroSD card and then use Fiio Music if you want to listen to music locally. There's a 4,000mAh battery, and the M21 lasts over 11 hours between charges. This is better than what I usually get with the M23, so again, the affordable model wins out.
 



Coming to power, the M21 provides 380mW at 16Ω and 290mW at 32Ω over the 3.5mm port, and 540mW at 16Ω and a generous 950mW at 32Ω via the balanced 4.4mm connector. Obviously, that kind of power is overkill, and in my use, the M21 managed to drive just about every IEM and headset I connected to it without any issues whatsoever. I used it with the Fiio FT7 and FT5, switching over to the Thieaudio Monarch MKIII IEMs occasionally.
The sound signature is similar to other Fiio digital audio players, with the M21 offering a neutral sound with a hint of warmth that livens things up. There's good energy in the low-end, clean mids with a focus on vocals, and good treble without any sibilance. It isn't as resolving as the M23, but it is mighty close, and it is much easier to use, and I ended up just switching to the M21 because of its portability.
 



Ultimately, the M21 has proven to be a realization. It has several tangible benefits over Fiio's costlier models, and it delivers a clean sound and plenty of power to drive demanding headsets. The design is much better as well, and on the whole, I think this is a better choice than just about any other player in this category — it's that good.
 




The M21 has a better design than the costlier M23, and it runs Android 13. The smaller size is better in daily use, and it has Fiio's signature sound, and power to drive the most demanding of headsets.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: MBA: Mortgage Delinquencies Increased in Q3 2025
A brief excerpt: From the MBA: Mortgage Delinquencies Increase in the Third Quarter of 2025The delinquency rate for mortgage loans on one-to-four-unit residential properties increased to a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.99 percent of all loans outstanding at the end of the third quarter of 2025, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) National Delinquency Survey.

The delinquency rate was up 6 basis points from the second quarter of 2025 and up 7 basis points from one year ago. The percentage of loans on which foreclosure actions were started in the third quarter rose by 3 basis points to 0.20 percent.

“Mortgage delinquencies increased in third quarter of 2025, led by worsening FHA loan performance,” said Marina Walsh, CMB, MBA’s Vice President of Industry Analysis. “Since this time last year, the FHA seriously delinquent rate – which includes 90+ day delinquencies and loans in foreclosure – increased by almost 50 basis points. In contrast, the conventional and VA seriously delinquent rates remained relatively flat.”

Added Walsh, “The stressors on FHA homeowners include a softer labor market, other personal debt obligations, and increases in taxes, homeowners’ insurance and other fees that exacerbate already stretched affordability. Additionally, home price declines in some parts of the country may lessen the ability to sell or refinance.”

Walsh also noted that while the third quarter results were not impacted by the ending of COVID-era FHA loss mitigation options and the recent government shutdown, those events may affect future quarters.There is much more in the article.

75,2025-11-14,"MLB Trade Rumors
 By Nick Deeds | November 14, 2025 at 8:32am CDT 
Here are three things we’ll be keeping an eye on around the baseball world headed into the weekend:
1. Trade market buzzing:
On the heels of this week’s GM Meetings, there’s been plenty of rumors about the trade market that will be worth monitoring as the offseason progresses. Cardinals super utility man Brendan Donovan, Royals southpaw Kris Bubic, and Mets veteran Jeff McNeil have all drawn interest from rival teams in recent days. All of those pieces appear to have real potential to move this offseason, but there are other longer shot trade candidates floating around the rumor mill as well. The Diamondbacks are getting plenty of calls on star infielder Ketel Marte, and the Mets are getting interest on mercurial right-hander Kodai Senga. Even with teams like the Reds and Astros publicly taking big names like Hunter Greene and Isaac Paredes off the table, there’s still plenty of early intrigue on the market.
2. Bullpen market heating up?
Yesterday, a report from Francys Romero of BeisbolFR suggested that the market for relievers could start moving in the early part of the offseason. That would be a sharp contrast to last winter, when top relief arms like Tanner Scott lingered on the market into January and even the earliest signings for veteran closers didn’t start until the Winter Meetings. There have already been plenty of rumors about the offseason’s top relief arms this winter.
Right-hander Brad Keller is garnering interest as a starter after a dominant year in the bullpen with the Cubs. The Red Sox, Reds, Dodgers and Marlins have been connected to Devin Williams, and the Dodgers have also been connected toÂ Raisel Iglesias as they look to bolster a middling bullpen that forced them to move Roki Sasaki into a ninth inning role this October. One other interesting wrinkle in the bullpen market this year is the presence of Edwin Diaz, who wasted no time in signing during his last trip to free agency when he inked a deal with the Mets in early November back in 2022. Could he or another top relief arm follow suit with a November deal this year?
3. Coaching staff additions continue:
While most of the focus is on free agency and the trade market at this point, teams are still doing the little things in the background to prepare for the 2026 season. That includes making alterations to and finalizing their coaching staffs. Just in the past few days, the Orioles, Twins, Reds, and Astros have all made significant coaching moves. More will surely continue to trickle in throughout the offseason, especially from the many teams that have hired new managers this winter. That’s also to say nothing of the Rockies, who still have to hire a manager after naming Paul DePodesta their president of baseball operations last week.

I’d really like Keller to come back to the Cubs, but if he’s getting this much interest then the price tag is definitely going up. Hoyer won’t spend on relievers so he’s probably not coming back. A starter is definitely needed so I expect movement on that this winter..

Keller has had 1…just 1 good year over the last 5 seasons….as a starter he got knocked around pretty well, and as a receiver he wasn’t effective until this past season….buyer beware….who is he….a starter or receiver and what will he produce in 2026 and beyond if you sign him multi year….hard pass….let the Cubs sign him and use him swing between the bullpen and spot starts…..

I’d love the Cubs to re sign Keller for the pen. But it all boils down to what he wants to do. Facts are facts. Starters are paid better than relievers. If he’s determined to try to start again then he’s probably going to have to settle for a job with a non contender or somebody willing to give him a chance. The Cubs really don’t need him as a starter despite what everyone thinks. The Cubs are looking for a  Bona Fide starter, If they wanted a lottery ticket they already have Assad, Wicks, Sanders, Noland , Wiggins etc. etc. etc.. Unless Hoyer can pull off a deal for a guy like Gore which I think is unlikely, Cease still makes the most sense for me. So if it’s take Cease or take a wild shot on Keller succeeding as a starter again I’ll take Cease. If I knew that Hoyer was going to trade Cam Smith for nothing when I was screaming for them to draft Yesavage this wouldn’t even be an issue.

“Dodgers… look to bolster a middling bullpen that forced them to move Roki Sasaki into a ninth inning role this October.”
That’s perhaps overstating things a bit. Yes the bullpen was a noted weak spot for them, but that didn’t ‘force’ them to move Sasaki to the pen. Roki had been pretty awful as a starter earlier in the season before being shutdown with a fairly lengthy shoulder issue. It’s doubtful he was stretched back out in time, and doubtful they would have had much confidence in him as a starter during the playoffs, so he was always going to the pen, whether it needed his help or not.
It worked out perfectly for the Dodgers as he was excellent in that role.

Canuckleball

They’ve already said he’ll be a starter. They think they’ve fixed his mechanical issues during his rehab from the shoulder issue so, barring any health setbacks, he’ll be a starter going forward and probably a pretty good one.

Sasaki probably needs time in AAA to adjust to being a ML starter, however, that would depend on what other moves the Dodgers make as right now it’s Yamamoto/Snell/Glasnow/Ohtani/Sheehan for sure in the rotation but if they stick with Ohtani only pitching once a week another starter or two will be needed. Landon Knack, Gavin Stone, Bobby Miller, and Justin Wrobleski are all on hand as depth options

Garcia maybe as he would fill the void in RF and give them the power bat they’ve been looking for (assuming last season was an outlier). I don’t really see a fit for Burger as they have Pasquantino at 1B, Maikel Garcia at 3B and need to keep DH AB’s open for Salvy as well as Caglianone

Yes they were and no he didn’t. Giambi was a finalist for the Rockies job after 2012 but lost out Walt Weiss. He signed with Cleveland and continued playing (rather sparingly) and basically served as a player/coach until retiring after the 2014 season.

The Phillies should call the Red Sox about Nick Castellanos (1/$20M) for Jordan Hicks (2/$25M). Theyâd shave $7.5M off the ledger for â26 and hope Hicks rebounds as a full time RP. The Sox have a lefty heavy lineup, Nick comes with some fan fare and could handle RF at Fenway. 
They should also call the White Sox, who are reportedly looking for a veteran rotation arm. How about Taijuan Walker (1/$18M) & CF Johan Rojas + 3 prospects like 2B Aroon Escobar (#5), 1B Keaton Anthony (#15) & C Caleb Ricketts (#22) – for RF Luis Robert (1/$20M) & C Kyle Teel. Phillies would only be adding $2M in salary, replace Castellanos in RF with Robert and get their Catcher of the future, whether they resign JT for a couple more years (they should), or not.
Here youâve rid yourself of your 2 worst contracts without eating salary, upgraded RF, added a young stud behind the dish and a middle reliever that still throws 100mph. Iâd also sign Pete Alonso to bat cleanup and share 1B/DH duties with Bryce Harper, Zac Gallen to be 5th starter and the Rogers twins L/R duo to solidify the pen. City of brotherly love, câmon.

You’re right dave. The Red Sox are also reportedly considering dealing from their outfield depth. They have no interest in Castellanos.

You say that, but probably have no knowledge of those prospects or the economics of baseball. Jordan Hicks was the worst pitcher in MLB last year, and the Sox are off the hook $12.5M in 2026. Only reason they are looking to trade is to free up long term salary to make another run at Bregman, and get more RH. This hypothetical trade accomplishes that. The White Sox probably paying Robert $20M, his production doesnât warrant that salary. So the proposal saves a few mil, add that veteran arm, while adding high upside prospects at positions you have no long term answer for. Only post on here to inspire critical thinking, not just a Philly homer and Iâve actually worked in professional baseball  – so Iâm entitled to my opinion regardless, just like everybody else.  Have seen way too many people say ârelease Castellanosâ, when there are other ways to move his contract.

NashvilleJeff 
3 hours ago
Instead of insulting me by claiming I ‘”probably have no knowledge of those prospects or the economics of baseball” you could include the facts concerning Robert’s correct position and salary. Robert plays CF not RF. He’ll earn $15M in 2026, w/2 Club Options in 2026/27 and a $2M buyout both years. Thinking you’re plugging Robert into RF for the Phils. No one said that you’re not entitled to your opinion. As an admitted Phils homer, you probably have more knowledge of the prospects you’re including in your trade proposal, but to me they seem to be 3 prospects w/no future in Philly, w/the possible exception of the 20 year old A ball 2Bman Escobar. He’s a lottery ticket. Who knows? Rojas was sent down in August 2025 and finished the year w/a quad injury. Very little value. From the WS pov, why would they deal a solid, cheap position player trade chip (Robert) and starting catcher (Teel) acquired a year ago in the Crochet trade for Philly’s unwanted quantity? Bad look for them to ditch Teel this soon and why would they anyway—-he played well for them. No need to trade for Walker when they could sign a cheap vet w/possible trade deadline upside for much less than Walker earns. It appears that you’re just balancing salary and trading off unwanted players to fill Phillies needs. I get it. Plenty do that on here, but claiming to “inspire critical thinking” w/proposals like these? Doesn’t seem any different than the many other BTV trade ideas floated on here. Instead of just saying you “actually worked in professional baseball” why don’t you talk about what your job was?

The clamshell foldable market feels like it’s stuck. Two big players dominate, each perfecting half the formula but never quite putting it all together.
What we have now is a tired duopoly and a huge opportunity for anyone willing to grab it. On one side stands the market leader, Samsung, with its new Galaxy Z Flip 7. On the other side is the Motorola Razr Ultra.
Right now, customers have to pick their poison. Samsung offers great design and high-quality photos, but a front screen that’s basically decorative.
Motorola fixes the front-screen usability issues, but you’ll pay extra for a camera that can’t keep up.
If any company can bridge this divide, it’s Google. People already want a Pixel Flip, that part’s clear.
But pulling it off will take more than dropping Pixel 10 hardware into a foldable shell. Google needs to look at what others missed and get five key things absolutely right.
 The cover screen is the heart of any flip phone, and it’s where Samsung keeps missing the mark. The hardware’s great — that 4.1-inch display looks incredible — but the mindset behind it is all wrong.
Samsung’s decision to wall off core features makes its front display feel half-baked, and Good Lock’s popularity is proof that users are patching what Samsung won’t fix.
Motorola lets the cover screen run full apps. It basically turns into a tiny phone, which is definitely more useful than Samsung’s half-locked version.
If Google wants the Pixel Flip to stand a chance, it needs to follow Motorola’s lead, not Samsung’s. Google, however, can take this idea much further by tying the cover screen directly into its AI ecosystem.
Imagine a call coming in and the screen instantly becoming Call Screen, showing you a live transcript.
On a trip, the Pixel Flip could act as a two-way translator in tabletop mode. Each screen could face a different person, showing translations for both sides.
 A Pixel that cuts corners on its camera isn’t a Pixel. For Google, compromising the camera is brand betrayal. Foldables have long asked buyers to trade photo quality for form factor, and 2025 hasn’t changed that.
Samsung’s Z Flip 7 sticks with a basic 50MP main and 12MP ultrawide, skipping a telephoto entirely. Motorola’s pricier Razr Ultra goes for a 50MP ultrawide, but its camera is fine at best.
Images often come out overexposed and soft, lagging behind even Samsung’s already limited setup.
Photography is a core reason people buy a Pixel. This is backed by Google’s decade-long lead in computational imaging. Therefore, a true Pixel Flip can’t exist without the complete camera setup.
Fitting a 5x periscope telephoto lens into a thin, folding body is no small feat, but it’s also Google’s biggest opportunity. Solving that engineering challenge would instantly set the Pixel Flip apart.
Google could also make Flex Mode finally mean something. Fold the phone halfway, and features like Camera Coach and Best Take can automatically activate for the perfect hands-free shots.
That’s the kind of user experience that’s uniquely Pixel. It’s a software advantage only Google can pull off, and it would instantly make every other flip phone feel dull by comparison.
 A Pixel Flip with a top-tier camera and an AI-powered cover screen is the dream. But the biggest threat to that vision is Google’s own silicon, the Tensor G5. It’s the same issue haunting the Pixel 10 Pro.
Despite the jump to TSMC’s 3nm process, Tensor G5 gets crushed by the Snapdragon 8 Elite. That said, raw performance is not the real issue. Tensor performs exceptionally well in AI-driven tasks.
Unless you are gaming heavily or editing large video projects, the performance is more than enough. Tensor G5’s real weakness is thermal control, which also causes micro-stutters and throttling.
Mind you, this happens in a full-sized slab phone, the best-case scenario for thermal management. With a unified battery and a solid chassis, it has room to breathe.
Now imagine that same chip inside a flip phone. A flip design is inherently thinner, splits its battery in two, and traps heat in tight spaces.
If the Tensor G5 already overheats in an ideal thermal setup, putting it into a folding chassis would be a disaster waiting to happen.
For the Pixel Flip to work, Google has to rethink its usual formula. What it needs is a lighter, efficiency-first chip, perhaps a G5e, that is tuned for cooler and more stable performance.
 Fixing the Tensor efficiency issue is only half the challenge. The Pixel Flip also needs to overcome Google’s outdated battery and charging hardware.
The 2025 smartphone landscape has a clear divide.
While some brands push toward 65-watt or even 100-watt charging, Samsung and Google are stuck in the slow lane.
The Galaxy Z Flip 7’s 4,300 mAh battery drains to about 30% by night and needs nearly two hours to charge at 25 watts. Google’s Pixel 10 Pro performs no better. Motorola, meanwhile, leads the field.
The Razr Ultra’s 4,700 mAh battery is widely regarded as a top performer. Its 68-watt wired and 30-watt wireless systems fill the battery in roughly 40 minutes, and Motorola claims 8 minutes is enough for a full day’s use.
Motorola has turned battery life and charging speed into its ace. In doing so, Motorola has proven that it is physically possible to fit a large battery and genuinely fast charging into a flip phone.
There is no justification for Google to release a Pixel Flip with its current battery and charging standard. At a minimum, it needs a 4,500 mAh battery and 45-watt wired charging.
To truly compete and erase any doubt, it should aim squarely for Motorola’s 68-watt benchmark.
 To compete, the Pixel Flip must first meet the physical contract of a 2025 foldable. These are the pass/fail tests that are no longer differentiators but are immediate disqualifiers if failed.
The first is the hinge and crease. Google cannot afford a first-generation crease. It must match or surpass the 2025 benchmark.
Next is durability. Every major foldable in 2025 carries an IP48 rating, including Samsung and Motorola.
That means strong water resistance — up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes — and basic dust protection for particles over one millimeter. Google has to hit that same mark at the very least.
Finally, Google must play its strongest card and offer long-term support. This battle is largely a draw. Samsung’s move to seven years of Android updates matches Google’s own commitment, putting them on equal footing.
However, both companies still outclass Motorola, whose three to four years of support and awful update speed make the $1,300 Razr Ultra a poor long-term buy.
The foldable market is fierce, but there’s still room for a player that refuses to compromise. For Google, the Pixel Flip could be that breakthrough and a chance to reassert its relevance.
The Pixel line has grown predictable. Yet the Pixel Flip is also a product that cannot win if Google sticks to its usual formula. Simply repackaging the Pixel 10 Pro experience in a foldable shell would guarantee failure.
The Pixel Flip must use its advantages in camera performance and AI intelligence as a Trojan horse to build a product that is more practical and more valuable than anything its competitors can offer.

In the wake of the government shutdown that resulted in nearly one out of every 10 flights getting delayed, you’d imagine the Trump administration would do something to restore its reputation and consumer confidence in air travel ahead of the holidays. But, wild pitch here: what if they did the exact opposite? In a new filing from the Department of Transportation, the Trump administration said it would kill a Biden-era rule that would have required airlines to provide meals, hotels, and cash to passengers hit with flight delays.
According to the document, the Trump administration has decided that it isn’t authorized under existing rules to require airlines to provide compensation to travelers, which seems like one of the few times it is concerned with what the law says. It also argued that the changes wouldn’t âyield meaningful improvements in airline flight performance.â Even if that were true, and performance didn’t improve, there would be a rubric in place to compensate people when their carrier of choice fails to get them to their destination on time. Now there is both no incentive to improve and also no mandate to compensate affected travelers.
The Trump administration cited industry groups representing the airlines that claimed the required payments could cost carriers up to $5 billion per year. The groups also not-so-subtly suggested that cost âcould potentially be passed down to American consumers in the form of higher ticket prices.â
Instead of the required compensation established under Biden, the Trump administration is going with the old “free market” approach. “The Department concludes that it is consistent with this statute to continue to allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines, and potentially consumers,” it wrote.
The Biden-era rule, first proposed in 2023, would have required airlines to pay travelers between $200 and $775, depending on the length of their delay, as well as offer free meals, lodging, and rebookings when flights were disrupted for circumstances within the control of the airlines. While most carriers do offer things like free rebooking and vouchers for food or hotels during extended delays, the rules vary depending on who you’re flying with. None of the carriers, prior to the Biden proposal, offered cash compensation for the inconvenience of getting delayed.
Had the rule gone forward, it would have standardized what people can expect from an airline during a delay. Instead, we’re back to a free-for-all. Consumers will surely take solace during their next delay that their airline won a battle in the marketplace of ideas to deny them compensation.

	Good afternoon Insiders, Max Goldbart coming to you after a week in which the British public broadcaster fell into crisis… once again. Read on. And sign up here.

BBC In Crisis

One Scandal Too Many: BBC crises bedeck these very newsletters with alarming regularity but this time Donald Trump is involved. It was one too far this time around for Director General Tim Davie, whose resignation along with that of news chief Deborah Turness came like a bolt out the blue late Sunday afternoon. Since the dual announcement, more details have emerged about the reasons behind the sudden exits, which concern the controversial editing of a Trump doc to make it appear as if the POTUS was inciting violence on Jan 6, although this was not the only issue raised by the excoriating Prescott memo that led to Davie and Turness’ downfall. A string of BBC all-staff calls have followed (Jake’s superb coverage makes you feel you were in the room) along with a $1B (yes, you read that right) legal threat from Trump. The BBC apologized yesterday but is refusing point-blank to pay a penny in compensation, and we now await Trump’s response. For what it’s worth, it seems incredibly unlikely that he would be able to get anywhere near that figure, and numerous legal commentators have rubbished his chances of winning full stop. Davie has fought hard these past months in the face of numerous scandals but there appears to be little fight left, and in all honesty few can blame him. His legacy is a tough one to immediately discern. Scandals consistently got in the way of any overarching vision and he maybe was never quite able to execute his grand plan. His replacement will need some serious mettle.

Disney Goes To APAC


			Watch on Deadline		






Town Schrier: APAC is a region growing in importance to Disney, and global TV pres Eric Schrier was on hand at the Mouse House’s APAC Showcase this week to chat to Sara and dive deep into strategy alongside APAC content head Carol Choi (pictured above). Since his high-profile departure from FX, Schrier has been heavily involved with goings-on in APAC and he now wants to look beyond the content behemoth of Korea, to Japan and Australia, for the next string of Disney global hits. Sara’s interview can be found here and is well worth a read. Feeding into the Japan strategy, there was plenty of new content for Deadline to get its teeth into at the APAC Showcase. J-pop group Travis Japan will be explored in a docuseries, while Disney+ unveiled a buzzy Korea-Japan co-pro with a working title of Merry Berry Love, a romcom following a down-on-luck Korean designer and a strawberry farmer who find love on a remote Japanese island. What’s not to like. Notably, as Eric and Carol were chatting to Sara, BBC Studios was re-jigging its APAC division in order to bring Australia and Asia under one roof.

	










AFM Gets Up & Running

Improving hit rates: “A needle in a haystack” was the phrase used by one veteran international buyer when pondering how difficult it is to launch successful indie movies in the current climate. “There are a fair amount of projects, but there is a clear absence of big independent propositions,” added the source, who was checking out the vibes at the American Film Market (AFM), which got underway earlier this week. Anthony and Andreas were analyzing a market that was cheered by the independent distribution community because of its return to L.A. after a failed Vegas experiment last year. The industry seemed enthused about the new venue, which is in close proximity to the agencies and Hollywood. Whether projects will land is another matter. We’ve broken a few big ones through the week – including Dakota Johnson sci-fi Trudy Blue, Geoffrey Rush comedy Shearing the Love and sales for Anthony Hopkins’ Dylan Thomas adaptation A Visit to Grandpa’s – but an analysis of the previous two editions found a pretty low hit rate. Many projects weren’t made or fell away, some are still to come, and a few failed to take off. This year’s crop will need a fair bit of wind in their sails way if they want to become part of the awards conversation or make some bucks at the box office. All AFM coverage can be found here.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Graphics cards (GPU) are one of the key ingredients in the Black Friday deal recipe, and traditionally, retailers seem to offer the largest discounts this time of year.
That's great news, especially since GPU prices have been falling of late due to fewer stock shortages and the fact that the latest AMD and NVIDIA hardware is coming up on a one-year launch anniversary.
Black Friday officially kicks off on November 28, 2025, with Cyber Monday falling on December 1. You certainly don't need to wait for the official dates to find a great deal, especially since some retailers, like Newegg, are offering price protection.
The Black Friday GPU deals are already underway, and I've rounded up the best NVIDIA and AMD discounts so far.

NVIDIA and AMD set an MSRP based on their own reference specs. For NVIDIA, its Founders Edition cards are priced at that MSRP, as are AMD's reference cards (which it didn't produce for the RX 9000 series).
Either way, NVIDIA and AMD's board partners take those specs and build their own GPU around them. In many cases, these third-party GPUs offer improved cooling and overclocking abilities, additional RGB lighting, and funky designs.
These adjustments drive the price up beyond the MSRP that NVIDIA and AMD have set. That means that you can't always rely on the MSRP comparison — it's often better to look at previous low prices, which I've included for each GPU deal here.
Black Friday officially lands on November 28, 2025. However, as with years previous, the deals kick off far before the official date. You can already find plenty of Black Friday deals available, and some retailers are offering price protection.
Cyber Monday falls on December 1, 2025, just three days after Black Friday. I'm expecting to see most deals carry through over the weekend, and there are usually additional discounts that pop up on Monday.
Black Friday and Cyber Monday traditionally have some of the deepest discounts of the year on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. I know that a lot of PC gamers have been waiting for the perfect opportunity to get a new graphics card without overspending, and I'll keep on top of this roundup to ensure you're always looking at the best prices.

89,2025-11-14,"Ignore the noise, says Strategy (MSTR) Executive Chairman Michael Saylor.

With bitcoin BTC$95,208.60 and Strategy's stock continuing their steep slides, Saylor in a Friday morning CNBC appearance said his company remains committed to its BTC accumulation strategy.

“We are buying bitcoin, we’ll report our next buys on Monday morning,"" Saylor said, adding that the company is ""accelerating [its] purchases,"" as he hinted that recent activity on the firm’s wallets will show aggressive accumulation.

That remark comes after online speculation earlier Friday suggested Strategy had been selling bitcoin as bitcoin and MSTR both tumbled. The rumors stemmed from on-chain data showing BTC moving out of company-controlled wallets.
Shortly following the CNBC appearance, Saylor took to X, saying ""There is no truth to this rumor.""
As for the plunge in bitcoin and what's next Saylor — per usual — advised frightened investors to zoom out, noting bitcoin was stuck in a range of $55,000-$65,000 only a bit more than a year ago. Even after the recent plunge, bitcoin at $95,000 today is still showing a pretty great return.
""We've put in a pretty strong base of support around here,"" said Saylor, who added he's comfortable BTC could rally from these levels.
MSTR is lower by 4% early Friday and below $200, now down nearly 35% year-to-date. Bitcoin is off its worst levels, but still 5.8% over the past 24 hours at $96,200.

For investors, the rumors weren't far-fetched. Strategy now holds more than 641,000 BTC — worth roughly $22.5 billion — while the company’s market cap has fallen below that value. The gap has pushed MSTR’s market-to-net-asset value (mNAV) below 1, a metric that suggests the stock may be undervalued. In that light, selling some bitcoin to stabilize the company might seem rational.

Norway's wealth tax increase, expected to raise $146M, led to a $448M net loss as $54B in wealth left the country, reducing tax revenue by $594M.

Alex Recouso
Co-founder and CEO

The recent wealth tax increase in Norway was expected to bring in an additional $146M in yearly tax revenue.Instead, individuals worth $54B left the country, leading to a lost $594M in yearly wealth tax revenue.That's a net decrease of $448M+.
The mass departure of Norway's billionaires has transformed into an unprecedented exodus, as the nation's tax administration grapples with one of Europe's most demanding wealth tax and income tax rates. Last year marked a watershed moment in this capital flight, with more than NOK 600 billion in assets leaving the country as high-net-worth individuals increasingly opted for tax havens over their homeland.
The phenomenon has caught the attention of global media, with The Guardian and other outlets documenting the steady stream of super-rich Norwegians seeking refuge in more financially hospitable jurisdictions.

Norway's approach to wealth taxation reflects a sophisticated yet burdensome system that interweaves multiple fiscal obligations.
Each municipality wields authority to levy its own tax rates, while the national government imposes additional charges on personal income, net worth, and various forms of capital.
The current structure encompasses property tax, value added tax, and capital gains tax, creating a comprehensive framework that has prompted many of the nation's wealthiest citizens to reconsider their residency.
The net wealth tax stands at the heart of this controversy. Unlike most OECD countries, which have abandoned such measures, Norway maintains a stringent wealth taxation system. While certain exemptions exist for business assets, the overall burden falls heavily on those with significant net worth.
The valuation of assets for tax purposes, particularly real estate holdings, frequently generates friction between taxpayers and the tax administration, as disagreements arise over assessment methods and fair market determinations.
Norwegian entrepreneurs and billionaires face particularly galling challenges under this tax regime.
The wealth tax rate, combined with dividend tax, often forces business owners to withdraw substantial funds from their companies solely to meet tax obligations. This creates a destructive cycle that hampers business growth and reduces incentives for domestic investment.
The situation becomes even more complex when you consider the exit tax regulations, which insidiously attempt to capture value from departing residents.
Consider the case of one prominent industrialist who faced an annual tax bill of NOK 175 million despite drawing a relatively modest salary from his business operations.
Such disparities between paper wealth and liquid assets have driven many wealthy Norwegians to seek alternatives abroad, with Switzerland emerging as a preferred destination.
The contrast with neighboring countries is notable. Not every EU and EU-adjacent country is taking the same approach as Norway and France.
Sweden, once renowned for its high wealth taxes, abandoned such levies years ago, recognizing their potential to drive away capital and talent. Finland and Denmark have similarly opted for different approaches to taxing their wealthy citizens.
Spain remains one of the few European nations maintaining a wealth tax, though its system offers more flexibility through regional variations and exemptions.
Switzerland's cantons have become particularly attractive to Norway's departing wealthy.
With its favorable tax base and various cantonal incentives, Swiss municipalities offer attractive alternatives to Norway's rigid system.
Cities like Lucerne actively court Norwegian expatriates, creating communities of former Nordic residents who share similar tax-driven motivations for relocation. The absence of inheritance tax in many Swiss regions provides an additional draw for family businesses considering relocation.
The treatment of real estate under Norway's wealth tax system presents particular challenges. Property valuations can vary significantly between tax assessment and market value, creating additional complexity for wealthy individuals with substantial real estate holdings.
This disparity affects both residential and commercial property owners, often forcing them to maintain higher cash reserves solely for tax purposes.
The Norwegian tax administration faces difficult choices as it watches its tax base erode. While property tax and value added tax provide stable revenue streams, the exodus of billionaires threatens significant portions of the government's income.
Recent estimates suggest that departing wealthy individuals control combined fortunes of at least NOK 600 billion - capital that now resides beyond Norway's borders.
The government's response has largely focused on tightening exit tax regulations rather than addressing the underlying causes of departure.
New provisions require departing residents to pay taxes on unrealized gains, with payment periods extending up to twelve years. This approach risks accelerating the exodus as wealthy individuals rush to relocate before new restrictions take effect. Austria, another European nation grappling with similar challenges, watches Norway's experience closely as it considers its own wealth tax policies.
In the broader context of international tax competition, Norway's experience offers crucial lessons about the limits of national tax sovereignty in an era of mobile capital.
While some European nations maintain certain wealth-linked taxes, most have moved toward more flexible systems that acknowledge the reality of global competition for high-net-worth individuals and their investments.
The pressure from tax havens and the mobility of modern capital pose existential challenges to conventional tax policies.
This dynamic particularly affects countries with high wealth tax rates, as they compete not only with traditional low-tax jurisdictions but also with nations offering specialized incentives for wealthy immigrants.
This is why obtaining second citizenship and multiple passports is a crucial diversification strategy in the modern world. Many investors are exploring options like Citizenship by Investment in Argentina to add geographic and legal flexibility to their planning.
The exodus has sparked intense public discourse about social equity and economic incentives. Each tax return season brings fresh reminders of wealthy departures, while policy makers search for ways to maintain public services without driving away the very taxpayers who contribute most to their funding.

Supporters of the current system argue that wealth taxes play a crucial role in maintaining Norway's social democratic model.
Critics counter that driving away successful entrepreneurs ultimately undermines the tax base needed to support social programs.
This debate extends beyond simple fiscal considerations to fundamental questions about the nature of social contracts in an age of global mobility.
As Norway grapples with these challenges, its experience resonates far beyond its borders. Other OECD countries watch developments closely, recognizing that Norway's wealth tax experiment may shape global tax policy discussions for years to come.
With billions of NOK in assets already relocated and more wealthy individuals considering departure, the pressure for reform continues to mount.
The story of Norway's wealth tax thus represents more than a simple tale of tax rates and capital flight. It embodies fundamental questions about the survival of progressive taxation in a world where capital moves freely across borders.
As the exodus continues, these questions become increasingly urgent, not just for Norway but for all nations seeking to fund robust social services while remaining attractive to mobile wealth and talent.
France just announced they will include Bitcoin as a taxable asset under the wealth tax, which means that French residents will pay taxes on the unrealized capital gains of their Bitcoin.
France just approved an ammendment to tax its citizens on global income if they move to a region with tax 50% lower than France's.

91,2025-11-14,"PNY halting of deals may signal deeper problems

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

PNY, one of the biggest names in PC hardware, has suspended its upcoming Black Friday promotions on USB flash storage, citing surging NAND costs.
The decision comes amid widespread reports of rising memory prices and growing concerns about the availability of storage components heading into 2026.
While early deals on peripherals, GPUs, and CPUs are still active, discounts on SSDs and memory products appear to be shrinking fast.
Memory makers are reportedly capitalizing on increased demand for chips used in AI hardware, driving up prices for NAND and DRAM.
Phison’s CEO recently confirmed NAND prices have more than doubled, with all production for 2026 already sold out.
Similarly, NAND and DRAM prices have risen by as much as 20%, signaling a tightening supply chain that’s affecting everything from high-end SSDs to USB flash drives.
PNY’s suspension of storage promotions might appear minor, but it hints at a deeper strain within the industry.
Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!
The company’s Elite Turbo Attache 4 flash drive, once discounted to $7.99 at Best Buy, was expected to drop further during Black Friday, but those plans are now uncertain.
Some listings remain discounted, while others have quietly returned to full price.
PNY representatives later clarified that not all deals are canceled, yet the decision reflects a cautious stance as supply grows unstable.
If NAND shortages are already trickling down to flash drives, the impact on SSD production could be worse than anticipated.
This mirrors similar slowdowns across the market. Enthusiasts tracking parts for custom PC builds have documented steep price hikes, particularly in DDR5 RAM kits.
In one case, a 64GB Kingston FURY Beast kit became more expensive than the Ryzen 7 9700X processor it was meant to accompany, an unusual inversion.
The current situation echoes past supply crunches but with sharper implications.
Unlike HDDs, which rely on mechanical parts, SSDs and USB flash drives are fully dependent on NAND chips, making them more vulnerable to these market swings.
As NAND and DRAM prices continue to climb, it’s unclear whether manufacturers like PNY can sustain consumer-friendly pricing or consistent promotions.

92,2025-11-14,"""The elephant in the room is that Valve just beat Xbox to the punch.""
The Steam Machine has been announced, and already chatter is loud regarding the potential impact Valve's new hardware could have on the console space. But the scope of its success, and what role it'll play in the future of the video game hardware market remains a mystery. That's what's so exciting about the whole affair.
Still, there are signs as to what could happen, given the right price point, the right market conditions. To find out more, Eurogamer spoke to Rhyss Elliott, head of market analysis at video game industry analysis company Alinea Analytics. From his point of view, the new Steam Machine may very well be a game changer.
The first question, and the most pressing in the mind of interested gaming enthusiasts,is how successful will this new Steam Machine be in this current market. The answer, for Elliott, depends on two major factors.
""That's really tough to predict, as both price and supply are a huge what-if,"" states Elliot. ""There are also so many Steam players who still use older components and want to upgrade, but cannot afford the rising prices. The Steam Machine could be the answer - if the price is right.
""Valve also needs to set a price that trumps current-generation consoles while effectively marketing its use cases over traditional consoles. This is a no-brainer for getting meaningful traction among console-curious gamers - not just PC enthusiasts.""
How much the Steam Machine will cost is an especially tantalising area of debate, given rising cost of hardware prices and the general cost of living crisis happening in many major gaming hubs around the world. For Elliott, the price point will be a real indicator of how the Steam Machine is perceived in this challenging market.
Elliot explains: ""If the Steam Machine launches above $500, it risks being perceived as an expensive niche PC (like the rumoured next-generation Xbox) rather than an accessible living-room gaming option.
""The sweet spot would be $400 with a controller. This would really send a message, as console manufacturers have been raising their prices. A digital PS5 costs $499, while the Xbox Series X Digital is $599.
""There are two different Steam Machine SKUs - a 512MB edition and a 2TB one. A $400-$450 floor price is feasible. I could see Valve selling a couple million Steam Machines next year at a price point like that, if they stagger their supply well (they've learned a lot from the Steam Deck) and get the rollout right.""
Another key factor as to the Steam Machine's success is a simple one, who is it for? With dedicated PC users likely already owning a relatively powerful system on which they can play the latest games, and those unfamiliar with PC gaming often put off by the price point of a modern setup. Is this greener group the target audience for the Steam Machine?
According to Elliott, there may be a largely unserved market for those looking to sit between console gaming and traditional PC gaming, which the Steam Machine may serve well.
""Valve says that around 20% of Steam Deck users - that's a few million - connect their device to a dock and play on TV. There's a clear appetite for a couch-friendly PC gaming experience"", Elliot says.
He continues: ""The use case is there, but the Steam Deck is a few years old now and is showing its age. Valve says its upcoming machine is six times more powerful. It's an attractive second device for PC gamers who want a living-room gaming setup without building a full rig or investing in another ecosystem.
""While a major part of the target audience is current Steam players, particularly for the first 2026 iteration, the Steam Machine also fits Valve's mission to make PC gaming more accessible and flexible, with no tinkering, fewer cables, and no drivers versus typical gaming PCs.
""Valve is making a console play here - or at least a living-room one. So obviously, the Steam Machine is not solely for hardcore PC players but also console-curious players who want the freedom and affordability of PC gaming without the complexity.
""For younger consumers, the Steam Machine could serve as an on-ramp to PC gaming, bridging the gap between consoles and the open PC ecosystem.""
Finally, can the Steam Machine actually cause a dent in the console market? Well, according to Elliot, Valve has absolutely acted quicker to reveal this kind of hardware than a major player in the space: ""The elephant in the room is that Valve just beat Xbox to the punch.""
Elliot elaborates: ""Microsoft's gaming hardware strategy has already been drifting toward PC. Xbox has been directly funnelling its core console fans there with devices like the ROG Xbox Ally X and the next Xbox hardware.
""Sadly for Xbox, Valve just built the bridge faster and might have offered an enticing console-like PC on-ramp for the disgruntled Xbox fans. And there are a lot of those (source: my DMs when I report anything marginally positive about Sony).
""The difference is that Valve owns the dominant PC storefront, while the Microsoft store has floundered. Steam OS and Big Picture mode are also pretty seamless, while Windows still has a long way to go when it comes to playing nicely with a controller. If successful, the Steam Machine could eat into Xbox's core proposition: console-like simplicity backed by PC-like openness.""
The trick is the openness of the Steam Machine, which like the Steam Deck can be opened up to a variety of different operating systems and gaming options for the savvy user. As Elliot explains, the Steam Machine may just be offering more than anything Microsoft can bring to the table.
""Players can install Windows or any other operating system they like on the Steam Machine, effectively turning it into a fully customisable gaming PC,"" Elliott says. ""That means access not just to Steam, but to the Epic Games Store, GOG, the Xbox app, or even Game Pass -  all within a small, living-room-friendly device.
""This flexibility puts Valve ahead of Xbox in its own race toward a ""PC-like"" console future. However, Microsoft is among Steam's top publishers by revenue, so they'll benefit too.
""In the end, the new Steam Machine won't outsell PlayStation or Nintendo hardware, but it doesn't have to. Its real purpose is to strengthen the Steam ecosystem by offering players yet another way to engage. If it manages to convince some younger and console players to migrate to PC (or extend their gaming to PC), then it's all the better for Valve.
""Each new Valve device is a signal boost for the Steam platform, increasing touchpoints and user retention across contexts. For Valve, this is more about attention than hardware dominance.""

94,2025-11-14,"In Q3 2025, Check Point Research recorded a record 85 active ransomware and extortion groups, the highest ever observed. What was once a concentrated market dominated by a few ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) giants has splintered into dozens of smaller, short-lived operations.
This proliferation of leak sites represents a fundamental structural shift. The same enforcement and market pressures that disrupted large RaaS groups have fueled a wave of opportunistic, decentralized actors, many run by former affiliates now operating independently.
Read the full Q3 2025 Ransomware Report 
Across more than 85 monitored leak sites, ransomware operators published:
Smaller actors are now posting fewer than ten victims each, reflecting a rise in independent operations outside traditional RaaS hierarchies. Many emerged from the collapse of RansomHub, 8Base, and BianLian. Fourteen new groups began publishing in Q3 alone, bringing the 2025 total to 45.
Fragmentation at this level erodes predictability, once the cyber security professional's advantage. When large RaaS brands dominated, security teams could track affiliate behaviors and infrastructure reuse. Now, dozens of ephemeral leak sites make attribution fleeting and reputation-based intelligence far less reliable.
Read the full Q3 2025 Ransomware Report.
Several high-profile takedowns this year targeting groups like RansomHub and 8Base have not meaningfully reduced ransomware volume. Affiliates displaced by these operations simply migrate or rebrand.
The problem is structural. Law-enforcement efforts typically dismantle infrastructure or seize domains, not the affiliates who execute attacks. When a platform falls, those operators scatter and regroup within days. The result is a broader, more resilient ecosystem that mirrors decentralized finance or open-source communities more than a traditional criminal hierarchy.
This diffusion also undermines the credibility of the ransomware market. Smaller, short-lived crews have no incentive to honor ransom agreements or provide decryption keys. Payment rates, estimated at just 25 to 40 percent, continue to decline as victims lose trust in attacker promises.
In September 2025, LockBit 5.0 marked the return of one of cybercrime's most enduring brands.
Its administrator, LockBitSupp, had teased a comeback for months following the 2024 takedown under Operation Cronos. The new version delivers:
At least a dozen victims were hit in the first month. The campaign demonstrates renewed affiliate confidence and technical maturity.
For attackers, joining a recognizable brand like LockBit brings something smaller crews cannot offer: reputation. Victims are more likely to pay when they believe they will actually receive decryption keys, trust that large RaaS programs carefully maintain.
If LockBit succeeds in attracting affiliates seeking structure and credibility, it could recentralize a significant portion of the ransomware economy. Centralization has a dual effect. It makes tracking easier but increases the potential scale of coordinated attacks.
DragonForce illustrates another survival strategy: visibility through branding. In September, the group publicly claimed coalitions with both LockBit and Qilin on underground forums. No shared infrastructure has been verified, and the alliances appear more symbolic than operational.
Still, these moves highlight ransomware's evolution toward corporate-style marketing. DragonForce promotes itself with:
The group's messaging reflects a competitive marketplace where image and credibility are as valuable as encryption speed.
Global targeting in Q3 2025 largely mirrored previous quarters but with distinct regional and sector shifts.
Read the full Q3 2025 Ransomware Report 
On the industrial side:
These shifts show how ransomware is guided by business logic more than ideology. Actors pursue sectors and regions with high-value data and low tolerance for downtime.
Q3 2025 confirms ransomware's structural resilience. Enforcement and market pressure no longer suppress overall volume; they simply reshape the landscape. Each takedown disperses actors who quickly resurface under new names or join emerging collectives.
LockBit's return adds another layer of complexity, raising the question of whether ransomware is entering a new consolidation cycle. If LockBit re-establishes dominance, it may restore some predictability but also re-enable large-scale, coordinated campaigns that smaller crews cannot execute.
For cyber security professionals, the takeaway is clear. Tracking brands is no longer enough. Analysts must monitor affiliate mobility, infrastructure overlap, and economic incentives — the underlying forces that sustain ransomware even as its faces fragment.

95,2025-11-14,"Genergo, an Italian deep-tech company based in Como, comes out of stealth and unveils an innovative electromagnetic space-propulsion system that uses no propellant, successfully flight-tested and validated across three space missions and protected by a portfolio of granted international patents.
Operational satellites equipped with propulsion carry propellant on board to perform orbital maneuvers, maintain position, and, in some cases, execute end-of-life atmospheric re-entry. Propellant takes up volume and adds mass - often further increased by the hardware required to manage it (pressurized tanks, control valves, feed lines) - introduces operational risks (leaks, explosions), and is, by definition, a finite resource. Once depleted, the spacecraft is no longer maneuverable and the mission ends.
Genergo’s system generates thrust without using any propellant and without expelling reaction mass, by directly converting  electrical energy into thrust through controlled electromagnetic impulses. To the company’s knowledge, it is the first space-propulsion system worldwide capable of operating without propellant, flight-tested and validated on orbit, and it represents a clear discontinuity from current standards. By design, the technology is scalable and operates with a modest power requirement.
The system also exhibits a highly sustainable profile: it uses no hazardous or toxic materials, requires no pressurized components to be stored on board, and introduces no risk of contaminating the space environment—either during operations or upon atmospheric re-entry.
After passing, on the first attempt and within a few months, all mission launch-qualification tests to the industry’s most stringent standards, the technology accumulated more than 700 hours of on-orbit operation across three missions launched between 2022 and 2023. The missions—still operational—were launched on SpaceX Falcon 9 as part of the Transporter rideshare campaigns (Transporter-5, -6 and -9) and hosted on D-Orbit’s ION Satellite Carrier spacecraft (platforms designed by the Italian company based in Fino Mornasco, Como, also used to carry and qualify emerging technologies in space). Over the past two years, multiple on-orbit activation cycles have continued alongside data analysis and characterization activities; additional tests are planned to further characterize the technology.
The campaigns confirmed system functionality in real space conditions, bringing the technology to a maturity level equivalent to TRL 7–8 (Technology Readiness Level). As additional confirmation of the results, several long-duration tests were conducted in which it was observed, objectively and repeatedly, that motor activation produced a measurable acceleration or deceleration of the host spacecraft.
The performance achieved to date by the flight-tested prototypes is already aligned with market requirements for specific mission profiles.
Several Italian organizations contributed to the project, including:
 The Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering (DEIB) at Politecnico di Milano, for laboratory bench measurements;
 The Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DAER) at Politecnico di Milano, which developed the spacecraft dynamics model for the on-orbit analysis of the first mission and produced the motor electromagnetic-emissions report required during preliminary qualification for on-orbit acceptance;
 An independent company specializing in high-technology solutions, which validated the in-orbit results using a broad set of methodological approaches, ensuring the robustness and repeatability of the observed performance.
 Genergo’s technology opens new perspectives for space missions.
Inaddition to further on-orbit campaigns planned forcontinued development, the first commercial application will be controlled deorbit—namely, lowering  a satellite’s orbit to guide atmospheric re-entry and ensure burn-up at the end of the mission.

99,2025-11-14,"Bitcoin-linked equities moved lower Friday as Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), Nakamoto Holdings (NASDAQ: NAKA), and Strive (NASDAQ: ASST) traded down in early market action as bitcoin dropped below $100,000. The digital currency is down 4% on the day at $96,485 at the time of publication.
Of the three companies mentioned above, NAKA fell the furthest, down 6%, while MSTR and ASST slipped 4% and 2%, respectively. 
NAKA’s decline comes after months of heavy selling pressure, as documented in an October 2025 investor memo from B. Riley Securities. The bank noted that NAKA shares had dropped 94% since July 1 and 44% year-to-date as of mid-October. According to the memo, the selloff stemmed from the company’s $5 billion at-the-market equity offering, a $30 million investment in Metaplanet (MPTLF), and insider sales following the expiration of PIPE lock-ups. 
Strategy, on the other hand, continues to be a stalwart for the industry, although its stock price has also suffered as of late. In recent news, the Virginia-based firm was assigned a B- issuer credit rating by the S&P rating agency. The rating is expected to open new credit markets for the firm as it continues to purchase Bitcoin.
Meanwhile, Strive continues efforts to expand its capital base following the completion of a $149.3 million oversubscribed initial public offering for its SATA preferred shares, according to company statements. While down 76% over the last 6 months, Strive is still up 131% year-to-date.
