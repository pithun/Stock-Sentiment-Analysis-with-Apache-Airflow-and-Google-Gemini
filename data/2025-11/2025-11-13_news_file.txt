Yeah, and the air stinks, too. Does it help to complain a problem that is fundamental to Slashdot's notion of time?
There are many stories that should last longer than it takes to scroll straight down the top page... Doesn't help that the real world is also uncooperative about scheduling when new stories will arrive. And substantive discussions are hard work, too.
The advantage of fiction is that all the noise can be trimmed away. The real world is full of noise without meaning, no matter how primed we humans

What you are seeing is CCP pouring massive subsidies into EV market, where these subsidies resulted in a bubble.



Chris Chapel from China Uncensored [youtube.com] does a good job explaining this.YouTuber SerpentZA also does a good job of exploring the topic, in a less detailed but more sensational manner:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvyb9Mp69ew. 
Skip to 8:05, 9:02, and 11:01 to see vast fields of these unwanted cars. And stick around to the end to see some spectacular footage of automobiles going off like bombs. Sometimes sensationalism is useful in underlining the importance of a point.

That's terrible, they poured $15.5B into the industry over the course 25 years.
Wait no, that was the US. And it was Boeing alone they poured that much into.
The US/Boeing and EU/Airbus have been arguing back and forth for years about each side's unfair aerospace subsidies (that are not subsidies if you ask them).
I used to follow Chris as he does draw attention to things the CCP would rather we didn't know about.  But when he started believing Trump will save us from China I was done.  Besides that, a lot of talk about China's imminent destruction is wishful thinking and just a touch arrogant.   Our own current form of capitalism isn't working so well either anymore.  The CCP will fall sooner or later, I have no doubt, and for many of the reasons Chris talks about.  But our western socioeconomic systems are just as

Actually most of those house are now occupied.  The ""train stations to nowhere"", supposedly an indicator of the imminent collapse of their economy, are now surrounded by industries and towns.
Not most, by far. Over 60 million housing units are still vacant, and in the previously completely empty cities where people have moved in, occupancy is often at 10% of capacity or so. A lot of the housing has simply been demolished, which has improved statistics somewhat, but a lot of unfinished housing also remains.
None of this is an indicator of collapse of the economy, and it has never been. The economy isn't dependent on people living in ghost towns. What it is an indicator of is massive private invest

Real estate by its very nature is fixed into place.  If there's no value in it in-place, then the only real value is the proceeds from dismantling and carting-off whatever's there.

You want a huge leap? Here you go.
No it isn't.  We can afford to be without a few bridges for awhile, when it costs your ENTIRE NATION to have that kind of executive ""build it now"" power for awhile.
China only managed to sustain that activity for a span of about two decades.  Now they're going down a hole, fast.
The scrabble for short term profits will always lose to adequate long term planning.
I’d be somewhat concerned if it was an isolated incident with just EV but China has a decades long history of this kind of corruption. Just look at the amount of real estate that was “sold” but sits vacant as new construction.  It dwarfs the EV market by a couple orders of magnitude.Not to mention the corruption in the construction industry itself - it's called ""tofu dregs"" construction. Look it up on YouTube - horrendous failures of buildings, bridges, etc.I've seen video of ""concrete"" pillars with a quarter-inch thick skim-coat of concrete covering a core of sand and compacted gravel. I've also seen water pipes meant to feed fire hoses - in fully-occupied high-rise buildings - that are utterly dry. They're simply not connected to any source of water. And I could go on.There's some scary, scary stuff that's taken for granted in China. Unsafe EVs are just one ugly danger among many faced by Chinese citizens as part of everyday life.

And causing massive damage to global economies and labor markets. We're looking at the gutting of the source of livelihood for millions of people here.  According to the AI chatbot I just looked at, approximately 10.8 to 14 million people derive their income from the European auto industry and around 4.5 to 8 million people from the US auto industry.
This is why trade policy protects against dumping.
Why would China care about that, especially today when the USA is imposing tariffs of 20 to 200% depending on how the wind blows in DC today, there's little progress on comprehensive trade agreements, Trump killed the TPP which for all it's flaws was structured around the idea that the nations in the Asia-Pacific region and the US should band together to have a united front of trade against China, instead we chose the ""everyone go it alone"" approach, a gift basket to China.
From where I sit there's an altern 
They care about it because it's exactly their plan - they tank the rest of the world's auto industry, then they take over.  We've seen this pattern with industry after industry.  This is why dealing with them is problematic - they are not operating in good faith.
This is why we have those tariffs.  Divesting from China is of utmost national security interest for the United States and should be for the European Union as well.
And just because Orange Man Bad doesn't mean you shouldn't keep your wits about you.  You strike me as the kind of person who would suffocate themself if Trump suddenly said he likes oxygen.
Sure but we know it's their plan that doesn't tell us anything unique.  Every country wants to dominate industries, it's good for countries.  The USA wants to dominate the auto industry as well, we're just arguing about methods and economic philosophy is just that, philosophy.  At the end of the day what matters is which nation produces the most batteries and cars that people can purchase and who can build the infrastructure to support that and despite our ""superior economic philosophy"" we are losing.
And no, the targeted tariffs are what we had in place for the auto industry specifically and that was give the US auto industry time to catch up, ideally it should have been with investment from the state to help transition the industry.  Obama and Biden tried that and Republicans have been trying to roll it back at every opportunity.  You can't just rely on tariffs forever and ever.
The general, broad global tariffs are just nonsense that hurts the USA more than it helps, its a shotgun instead of a scalpel and it only encourages China to go it alone.  You say the nation needs to divest and yet the admin has been talking about wanting a trade deal with China for the entire year, it's incoherent because these people don't know what they are doing.
 You strike me as the kind of person who would suffocate themself if Trump suddenly said he likes oxygen.And that is exactly the stupid grievance based zero-sum turn off your brain thought process of conservatives that has gotten us into this mess.  ""Rational economic thoughts? Nah, TDS baby! The 19th century mercantilism will continue until morale improves""

What I find funny is how people on the left have suddenly discovered Milton Friedman in their railings against Trump.

 China is proving that massive government investment builds economies.Nobody needed China to prove that, as you mentioned it was already proven in most of the Western world already it's just fighting through the fog of politics to enact those measures.Friedman like all economists has predictions that have been borne out well and others that have not.  Economics is a soft science since for all the math it's still just down to making an educated guess and seeing what happens.

for all the math it's still just down to making an educated guess and seeing what happens.Which is not really science at all is it? In Science you are supposed to make a hypothesis and then test it. Not guess and assume your guess is correct until proven wrong. Then make a new guess when you are proved wrong.

Yes, thus the term ""soft science"", it's colloquial, the definition of science has changed over time.
Sociology is still a real study of real things even if it's limited in its ability to do experimental testing.  Same with economics, we don't have a second Earth to run a control on.  Doesn't mean these things don't use scientific principles and methods.
Doctors still do science even if they are ethically constrained on how much experimental testing they can do on patients.
This is why we have those tariffs.No, it's not.  Otherwise the tariffs would only have been imposed against China.Gave me a real WTF moment when Trump went on and on about tariffs against China, and the first tariff that went into effect was against Canada, one of our best trading partners.

I know another guy in the process of fucking up the global economy.
European manufacturers are finally getting their act together on EVs it seems. The Skoda Elroq is probably going to be the best selling EV this year, in the UK.
We need EVs, we need to get off oil. Some pain is inevitable, all we can do is delay it, which makes it worse.
 we need to get off oil. We don't and we can't. More so, even in context of EVs - you can't manufacture one without significant amount of materials that are derived from petroleum.
 we need to get off oil.
 We don't and we can't. More so, even in context of EVs - you can't manufacture one without significant amount of materials that are derived from petroleum.
We will never totally stop using oil of course, but we need to mostly stop burning it for fuel, outside of a limited number of applications. We need to do something about plastic pollution too.
I'd say that will he the harder transition to manage. Electrifying everything isn't too difficult and most of the tech is already mature. Replacing or dealing with plastic pollution seems harder, as will be dealing with increasing costs as fuel oil product consumption is greatly reduced.

Besides, since there's not the full needed infrastructure here across the US, no one really wants them yet, at least not in mass.
The rush is that burning it is buggering up the planet. If the US refuses, it becomes a security issue and we be dealt with appropriately.
""There's no difference between using oil to make durable materials and burning it up to make thing hot""
If you have to lie about what folks on the other side of your argument think you either don't understand them or are just maliciously lying about it.  Nobody says ""No oil for anything ever"" but burning gasoline to move one human being from point A to B is incredibly stupid when we have a better alternative.
Bad for you.  Bad for me.  Good for China.
The CCP don't care about you and me.  Or about Chinese people.  Or Chinese corporations.  Only about the future of China.  Everyone and everything is expendable in the service of their goals.  This is just a small item on the checklist.  The cost is irrelevant as long as the plan moves forward.
Detroit is doing its level best to kill EV competition already.
No, but their customers are.
They don't have to.  They only have to subsidize it enough to tank the rest of the world's auto manufacturing.  Then, they become the only one left, a monopolist in a market with a huge barrier to entry.  They can pull their subsidies at that point and rake in the excess profit.
This is a classic trade manipulation strategy.  It's taught in undergrad business classes.

They probably forgot to tell the companies they subsidized that they were trying to dump on the global market in order to buy a longer term lead.  And that it may not work out too well in the end.  I can't imagine any other purpose for them propping it up so hard.  The US never became a market for these, but the US trade war has had ripple effects in their other markets and is probably collapsing the propping up that China is doing.
Yes, such overinvestement wouldn't happen in a capitalist society ... like AI, or telecom, or railways, or... Anyway, AI datacenters also try to get as much as possible subsidies, government contracts, etc. They just have to sell it differently to the government, but it all comes down to ""We cannot afford a mineshaft gap""
I think the point is that the myth of the ""all knowing, all efficient free market will always choose the right move versus the communist central planners"" isn't really true at all, they are just as capable of corruption, bureaucratic paralysis, glad handing, and generally bad economic decisions all around.  Government or corporations it's just people making decisions and reacting to incentives and many of the incentives in capitalist countries can be wildly perverse.
Free market is a representation of distributed decision making, where you have hundreds of people evaluating the data and making decisions. It's presented as that and yet we have lived in the era of the ""corporate raider"", ""CEO is king"" culture for decades now and the track record isn't exactly holding strong.Corporations have become condensed and far more vertical than 50 years ago with far less competition (which is really the controlling force more than decentralized decision making ever was) and capital is more concentrated in a few hands than ever before.  The economy turns on what places like Blackrock, Silverlake and the Mag7 decide what

I'm sorry welcome to your first day of the English language. Why do you think i put it in quotations, I'm exaggerating for effect.
Easier to scale back than to scale down.
Look at it from China's POV, you have this massive manufacturing base and yet in the traditional auto market they aren't kept out by trade deals but the fact it's hard to make inroads in an industry dominated by the Americans, Europeans and Japanese companies.
Along comes the sea change that EV is bringing and if you're china 10 years ago and suddenly those 3 nations are looking to completely drop the ball.  Honda and Toyota focussing on dead tech like hydrogen, the Am 

I only mention this because you're comparing a command economy where it is the national government making production decisions, to independent companies in free market economies.
These are mixed economies, the government creates many regulations, trade agreements and other matters that affect their businesses.  There was a reason in 2008 we bailed out the US auto makers, we as a nation value that industry, for the jobs, national security and general prestige and tradition.  This isn't central planners VS laissez-faire but levels of mixed-economy VS mixed-economy.  To think those industries and state aren't intertwined in many important ways is naive at best.
At the end of the day eco 
""making production decisions"" is carrying a lot of water, business decisions are not made in a vacuum, they respond to incentives both from consumers, their competition and the state apparatus.  Automakers didn't just decide to add 3-point-seat belt's or emissions controls into vehichles because of their own accord, they were either forced or incentivized to.
The inventive in the US for it's auto industry has ping ponged between ""let's help transition you to a future EV world"" to ""gasoline is good, big truck 
Central planners tend to consider fewer factors, or simply the wrong factors. It's extremely shortsighted to treat that as axiomatic and not on the specifics.

Overproduction is never a success, it's waste.Overproduction is an absolute requirement for a market economy to function, you incredible dummy. If aggregate supply didn't exceed demand, then there would be no price signals and no bankruptcies, and the competition that is central to how markets work would be gone. There is not a major capitalist market that has ever existed that has not had recessions, gluts and inventory build-ups, and this is not only to be expected, it's essential to how markets operate.I doubt the EV's sitting on lots, whether in China or the US,  are going to end up unused and in a junkyard. But Wall street investors measure success by company profits and stock price, not production of useful goods. Making something useful and selling it at a loss is a failure, not a success. But for the person getting the use of the product that doesn't really matter. China's history may make it more focused on the user's interests.

Chinese industry is like this. Lots of companies pop up doing the same thing, most of them fail, the best ideas are scooped up by the companies that remain, and a few strong sustainable companies survive. This is not just a Chinese thing. It happens in the USA, too. Most American tech startups fail; 70% fail between years two and three and most fail in the first five years.

Assassin's CreedUbisoft 
Usually Ubisoft is delaying its upcoming games. Sometimes it delays big updates to ones that are already out. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen it delay its official quarterly earnings report and certainly not minutes after it was already due to be released. Did someone accidentally delete a spreadsheet or is the Assassin’s Creed publisher getting ready to break some major news?
Like every other publicly traded video game company, Ubisoft regularly releases quarterly updates on its financials and takes questions from investors and analysts on an earnings call. The latest round was supposed to go live today at around 12:00 p.m. ET, only it didn’t. Instead, minutes passed with no update as people prepared to join the conference call that’s traditionally helmed by CEO and cofounder Yves Guillemot.
Then Ubisoft released its weirdest emergency press release ever. “Ubisoft announces the postponement of the release of its results for the first half of fiscal year 2025-26,” it read. “Ubisoft has requested Euronext to halt trading of its shares (FR0000054470) and its bonds (FR001400DV38, FR001400MA32, and FR0014000O87) from the market opening on November 14, 2025, until the publication of its first-half 2025-26 results in the coming days. Ubisoft will inform the market of the date on which trading will restart.”
That’s a big last-minute change with no clear details on when things will be back to normal.
Yes, this could imply an acquisition of sorts. Could also imply some accounting / financial issue. 
Just remember to freak the fuck out for the next few days and speculate as much as possible until they announce something.
— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) November 13, 2025

“Unclear why at this point but could indicate a major announcement related to the company,” wrote Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad on X. He noted that this could be a prelude to some big acquisition announcement, or it could signal a financial or accounting issue that requires extra time to address before accurate data can be supplied to the public.
It might be easier to assume the latter if not for what a weird time this is in general for Ubisoft. The long-time publisher recently entered into a $1.25 billion bailout with Chinese conglomerate Tencent. It used that money to spin off a new entity run by the CEO’s son. After a slew of recent delays, there are no major new blockbuster releases for the company on the immediate horizon. The stock price is at its lowest point in over a decade.
It certainly wouldn’t be shocking if Tencent, another big game company, or a “consortium” of various other investors used this opportunity to swoop in and try to buy the struggling publisher, or at least some big chunks of it. With its most lucrative franchisesâAssassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six Siegeâall snugly nestled within a new subsidiary called Vantage Studios, Ubisoft is trying to find a way to offload other big chunks to outside groups. Anybody interested in the Splinter Cell or Prince of Persia series as their remakes remain MIA?
The company recently announced voluntary layoffs across its Swedish studios, which include Massive, the lead studio on the Division franchise. With Activision Blizzard gobbled up by Microsoft and EA sold to Saudi Arabia, who can say what will happen next? I just hope Beyond Good and Evil 2 somehow survives.
Update 11/13/2025 2:36 p.m. ET: Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet sent an email, a copy of which was viewed by Kotaku, to rattled staff today trying to explain why he couldn’t explain what is going on:
Hello everyone, I wanted to let you know that we are taking extra time to finalize the closing of the semester, and as a result we will publish our first-half earnings results in the coming days instead of tonight. Due to legal regulations, we cannot share more information with you at this time.
To limit unnecessary speculation and market volatility during this short delay, we have asked Euronext to suspend the trading of our stock until the results are announced. We know this is likely to raise questions and drive media coverage. I encourage you to listen to the conference call â which will be available via the Investor section of our site â just after the results are released so that you have a more detailed view of our earnings. Thanks for your understanding.
The fate of thousands of Ubisoft developers is potentially up in the air as those who won’t be working on Vantage Studios projects face possible cost-cutting pressures or the uncertainty of their studios being sold to outside companies.

Certain executives may be sitting on small fortunes as Nvidia's stock ascends to new heights, though that doesn't always translate to lavish work perks.
One executive at the chip giant, Vladimir Troy, shared on LinkedIn Monday that vice presidents at Nvidia, which has a market cap of over $4 trillion, fly economy when traveling for work.
Troy, who is vice president of AI infrastructure at Nvidia, attributed the modest benefits at the world's most valuable company to its ""one team"" culture.
""No special treatment; everyone equal to focus on the mission and do their life's work,"" Troy wrote.
Troy also wrote that Nvidia VPs don't have executive assistants.
That being said, some Nvidia executives do have executive assistants, according to LinkedIn profiles and company blogs.
Troy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.
Nvidia has described its ""one team"" culture as one that avoids politics and hierarchy. It is known for implementing a flat structure with CEO Jensen Huang overseeing many direct reports to aid in information flow.
""It's not that management hierarchies aren't respected; there's reasons for it,"" a former Nvidia VP told Business Insider.
The VP added that Huang's ""general mentality is you should always be learning and if you can help, you should.""
It is unknown which executives at the company are eligible for executive assistants and luxury travel.
Edie Fischer, chief executive assistant, reports to Huang, per an internal list obtained by Business Insider, and chief information officer Sonu Nayyar also has an assistant, according to the company's blog.
On LinkedIn, several employees say they work as executive assistants for the head of automotive Xinzhou Wu, executive vice president of worldwide field operations Jay Puri, VP of finance and chief accounting officer Donald Robertson, and VP of EMEA Jaap Zuiderveld.
For his part, Huang is also reported to occasionally travel by private jet, a common practice among top executives.
Salesforce capped CEO Marc Benioff's private jet and security expenses at $4.6 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, while CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a private jet he leases to Meta for occasional use per a time-sharing agreement.
Google also paid for personal use of company-owned aircraft for top executives in 2024.
And while Oracle said executive chairman Larry Ellison and executive vice chair Safra Catz could use company planes for personal travel in fiscal 2025, its policy for professional services employees states airfare is ""limited to coach/economy accommodations.""

With the holiday approaching fast, now is a great time to get a head start on all of your gift shopping. Whether you have a low budget White Elephant coming up at your office or you’re just looking for another good stocking stuffer for your high school to college-aged kid, consider this. INIU’s portable charger is something anyone that owns a phone would greatly appreciate, which is probably most people you know. The portable charger is normally listed on Amazon at $36. However, a limited time deal is bringing the price down by 37% and it’s not even Black Friday or Cyber Monday yet. Right now, that savings of $14 brings the price you pay down to just $22.
See at Amazon
This portable charger from INIU is the perfect travel buddy. It’s small in stature, able to fit in your pocket alongside your phone easily. It only measures in at 3.2 inches by 1.5 inches by 1.1 inches and weighs just 4.1 ounces. The charger even comes with a built-in keychain so you can clip it easily to your backpack or bag. Or just keep it on your keys so you always have it with you. Perfect for charging during trips or long commutes. It’s also TSA compliant so you’ll have no trouble taking it with you through the airports while traveling.
You’ve got lots on things you carry on you that need to be recharged every now and again. This portable charger can help you out with it’s built-in USB-C charging cable as well as the 5W wireless charger for Apple Watch. It’s also got an additional USB-C port in case you need to charge two phones at once.
Despite it’s compact form , this portable charger can pack a lot of backup power. With 5,000mAH on hand, the power bank can provide an Apple Watch with six full charges or an iPhone 16 with up to 91% from zero, giving you that reliable boost of power when you really need it.
It’s fast too. With Power Delivery support and 20W output, you can bring an iPhone 17 Pro up to 56% in just 25 minutes time. When it’s time to charge the portable power bank itself, it can do that fairly quickly as well. It can reach full charge from 20% in just two hours time.
The digital display on the front is there to let you know exactly how much power the charger has left in it. This can help prevent you rushing out the door with it, expecting it to be at full charge but then you realize you had forgotten to plug it in. You get a simple three digits indicating what percent battery the charger has left.

Are those sleigh bells I hear? No, sir. Those are PokÃ©balls. December is approaching faster than a Blaziken’s Quick Attack. With the holidays right around the corner, why not have some extra fun counting down to Christmas this year? You and your family can celebrate the beginning of the holiday season with this advent calendar from Funko Pop. This set is packed with daily surprises in the form of mini Funko Pop vinyl figures of a handful of your favorite PokÃ©mon. Amazon usually lists the mystery box holiday calendar for $50, but ahead of Black Friday, the site has it going for 10% off. That saves you a cool $5, bringing the price to just $45 for a limited time.
See at Amazon
This makes an ideal gift for PokÃ©mon fans of all ages. Just get it to them before December, otherwise that kind of defeats the purpose of an advent calendar. How it works is the mystery box contains four rows of six small doors, each containing a beloved PokÃ©mon character. Starting on December 1, you can peel back the layer to reveal who it is behind it waiting in vinyl Funko Pop form. One day, you’ll find Caterpie, the next you might Bulbasaur, then after that maybe Piplup. Every day for 25 days, you get to reveal a new pocket-sized friend.
All PokÃ©mon included are featured right on the box. If you want to keep yourself surprised, I suggest you neither not look at it too closely nor read the following list, detailing each of the 24 Funko Pop PokÃ©mon included:
Predictably, most featured are Gen 1 though there are some later generation favorites getting some love too. 16 are among the first PokÃ©mon we met on our Game Boys back in 1999 while the other nine comprise of mainly later generation starters and various new Eeveelutions.
Each figure is smaller than the standard, popular Funko Pop figures. They measure in individually at a maximum of two inches tall. They are made from a durable vinyl materials. As collectibles, these are built to lastâable to withstand daily wear of playtime too.

Real Christmas trees shed needles everywhere and always need watering while the inexpensive plastic decorations look tacky and inevitably end up in landfills after a single season. LEGO does a different holiday set each year, and this Christmas tree model has become the bestselling seasonal set of them all – Amazon’s moved over 40,000 units alone. Timing couldn’t be better here because Amazon’s clearing out remaining inventory before Advent starts, dropping the price to $26 from the usual $44. That’s a 40% discount and an all-time low on a set that’s extremely popular.
See at Amazon
This 2-in-1 design provides flexibility in how you display your creation: You can build one larger Christmas tree display model that commands attention as a centerpiece or split the pieces into two mini Christmas tree models that work perfectly on shelves, desks or windowsills. This choice is important because not everyone has the same amount of display space during the holidays, when surfaces get crowded with cards, decorations, and seasonal clutter.
Each one of them is decorated with various ornaments and candles; they are crowned with a yellow star that perfectly illustrates the concept of a Christmas tree. The details include traditional holiday colors and decorative elements that make the finished build look festive without being overwhelming. These are not just green bricks stacked in a triangle shape.
The build itself provides a satisfying project to work on during the holiday season. LEGO recommends this set for ages 12 and up, which means it offers enough complexity to keep tweens, teens, and adults engaged without being frustrating. You can tackle the build solo as a relaxing evening activity or make it a group project with friends and family looking to do something together beyond watching movies or eating cookies.
Once done, the model goes from toy to home decor you can proudly display in any room. The taller tree configuration stands over 11 inches tall, tall enough to serve as a tabletop centerpiece for holiday gatherings or family dinners. The smaller models stand over 9 and 6 inches tall, respectively, fitting comfortably on mantels, bookshelves, or office desks where full-sized decorations might be impractical.
At $26, you’re spending less than most people pay for a decent bottle of wine or a restaurant meal, but you’re creating something that becomes a part of annual holiday rituals instead of being consumed and forgotten.

7,2025-11-13,"From the outside, it looks like virtual and mixed reality is having a moment. Three new headsets have launched or been announced in the last month: Apple's M5 Vision Pro, the Samsung Galaxy XR, and, just this week, Valve announced the Steam Frame. Given the m…"
8,2025-11-13,"[Mellow Labs] wanted to grab a multimeter that could do Bluetooth. Those are cheap and plentiful, but the Bluetooth software was, unsurprisingly, somewhat lacking. A teardown shows a stock Bluetooth module. A quick search found a GitHub with software. But then he had a fiendish idea: could you replace the Bluetooth module with an ESP32 and use WiFi instead of Bluetooth?
This was as good an excuse as any to buy a cheap logic analyzer. Armed with some logic captures, it was easy to figure out how to fake the meter into thinking a Bluetooth client was connected.

Oddly enough, the data is “encrypted” with XOR, and an AI website was able to identify the raw data versus the encrypted data and deduce the key. The rest, as they say, was software. Well, except for one hardware problem: The ESP32 needed more power, but that was a fairly simple fix.
The entire thing fit the case beautifully. Now the meter streams a web page instead of requiring Bluetooth. Great job!
If your meter isn’t handheld, you can still play a similar trick. Just don’t forget that when it comes to meters, you often get what you pay for. Not that you can’t do a similar hack on an expensive meter, either.

Well worth the watch. Crazy that the manufacturer encrypts the internal data in transit on the PCB to the Bluetooth module. It’s your own measurement data FCOL.
Definitely a hack!  And another great story by Al W.  :-)
Just finished the video … well done hack and exploratory work with new tools (to him) to accomplish what he was looking to do 👍
This is a cool hack, but it’s also a good time to remember that just because you CAN put something on the internet doesn’t mean you SHOULD.
Has he put it on the inernet or just his local LAN though?
“Oddly enough, the data is “encrypted” with XOR, and an AI website was able to identify the raw data versus the encrypted data and deduce the key.”
I wonder whether the AI just picked up the XOR key from the website that the video also used as a reference.. they keys in https://github.com/FireMarshmellow/DMM_Web_interface/blob/main/python/ble_dmm_min.py and https://github.com/ludwich66/Bluetooth-DMM/wiki/Bluetooth-DMM-10-Byte-Data-Protocol appear identical.
No mention about the battery life after the mod :)
It’s a useful idea, I’ve got an old 4.5 digit LED bench meter which pushes the display segment data out via a serial port, might be an interesting experiment to update it
Oh heck, he’s not put any electrical isolation on the USB connector, it will be live at whatever voltage he’s measuring
That was the moment I closed the video…
The battery compartment is a huge hole with a nice set of covers. Why not replace it with a LiPo battery, usb charger and a Low-Standby-Supply Current regulator? Should all fit in and has a nice cover.
Nice! But this logic analyser needs firing up PulseView, what if you could view its output from a web app instead? ;p
The link “on an expensive meter” in the article doesn’t seem to point to the intended resource but to the HAD admin frontend instead.
Cool project.
I still think using esp32 to bridge the wifi and BT is more practical (smaller battery drain on device, no hardware mods needed). Integrating this to Home Assistant would be really cool for creating ad hoc automations. Something like:
If voltage in this battery falls below that level turn off this wifi socket, turn this wifi bulb to red color and send me notification.

9,2025-11-13,"Valve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.
The Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer.
It is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants.
Prices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more.
The Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced.
The company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown.
Since Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.
Around 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics.
But whether its new hardware can match Steam's success will remain to be seen when the devices launch next year.
Analysts previously cast doubt on the Steam Machine's significance when it launched in its original, clunkier form a decade ago - saying its price-tag and potential might only really entice Steam ""power users"".
In a video announcement, Valve described the new console as ""a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package"".
The firm argues the device is ""optimised for gaming"" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy.
Powered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, Valve said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second.
But industry expert Christopher Dring said its potential and appeal may be limited, comparing it to the firm's handheld Steam Deck console which has a ""lucrative but niche"" audience of ""around four to five million players"".
""Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,"" he said.
""My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting."".
In an unusual move, Valve has also announced further hardware - its Steam Frame virtual reality (VR) headset.
The device is entirely wireless - and it described it as a ""streaming-first"" device - but it is also itself a PC running SteamOS.
And it also claims to be bringing a technical leap forward in the VR space, with the headset displaying highest-quality graphics only in the bits of the screen a user is looks at.
With the sweeping new device announcements, Valve hopes to rival its more established competitors.
In recent years, Microsoft-owned Xbox has placed its subscription service Game Pass at the heart of its offering for gamers - some say at the expense of its console crown.
Meanwhile the PS5 has been the best-selling console for some time, but fans have been left asking when its successor will appear on the market.
Brandon Sutton, games industry analyst at Midia research, said the announcements showed Valve's ""strong grasp of where the gaming market is headed and what gamers want"".
""With Sony and Microsoft moving away from console exclusives, and the prevalence of games streaming services, it has never been a better time for a PC-Console hybrid,"" he told the BBC.

Social media users also struggle to grab the game on the Nintendo, PlayStation and Xbox game stores.
After delays caused by global supply chain issues, Valve's handheld PC has finally been released.
Unexpected high demand means supplies of many pre-orders of the gaming console have been delayed.
The troubled card game is the latest promised rework to be abandoned by a major developer.
Valve and five other gaming publishers broke competition law by geo-blocking games in Europe, says the EU.

Apple never discounts its products directly so third-party retailer deals are especially noteworthy for anyone looking to save on premium hardware. Amazon just kicked off Black Friday pricing for several Apple devices including AirTags, MacBook Air models, and the brand-new Mac Mini with M4 chip. The 2024 Mac Mini is Apple’s more affordable desktop computer, and the 256GB model is now available for $499 instead of its usual $599 price. That’s a $100 discount and an all-time low for a machine that’s only been on the market for roughly a year now.
See at Amazon
The M4 is among the latest generations of Apple silicon and brings impressive boosts in performance from what was a breathtakingly remarkable M2 that powered the last Mac Mini. The processor houses 10 CPU cores-again, a mix of performance and efficiency cores-allowing the system to handle tasks dynamically, depending on their computational demands.
The GPU here is an integrated 10-core GPU on the same chip as the CPU for all graphical processing. It does away with discrete graphics cards while still offering high-end visual performance. This unified architecture allows the GPU to share the same 16GB of unified memory as the CPU, meaning that in graphics-intensive applications, data access is way quicker than in systems where the GPU has separate video memory that constantly needs data transfers.
Speaking of memory, the 16GB of unified RAM is a significant upgrade from the base 8GB configuration Apple used in previous entry-level Macs. You can run many applications simultaneously without the slowdowns that occur when systems begin swapping data to storage. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open while working in productivity apps, editing photos, and listening to music without the frustrating lag that comes from too little RAM.
The 256GB SSD will provide fast storage for your operating system, applications, and files. Solid-state drives allow for near-instant boot times and app launches compared to traditional hard drives, while Apple’s custom controllers push read and write speeds even further than standard SSDs. This capacity works well if you primarily use cloud storage services or external drives for large media libraries, though heavy users who store extensive local file collections might want to consider external storage solutions or the higher-capacity models.
The Gigabit Ethernet is built into the Mac Mini for wired network connectivity, thus offering more stable and faster internet in many situations than Wi-Fi. It proves very helpful when transferring huge files across your local network, streaming high-bitrate video content, or keeping reliable connections during video calls and remote work. Inclusion of Ethernet at the base price level means you don’t need to purchase adapters or sacrifice USB ports for network connectivity; wired connections eliminate the interference issues that sometimes plague wireless networks.
Apple Intelligence offers advanced machine learning on the desktop and automates a range of tasks from intelligent writing assistance and image generation to enhanced Siri capabilities. Because these features are local on the M4 chip and run without using the cloud, execution is faster and more private, since your data never has to leave the device.
Its compact design measures 5 inches square and 2 inches tall, and occupies only a minimum of desk space but delivering full desktop performance.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Eric Sim, 55, a former banker who became a published author, professional speaker, and career coach. The following has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his education and employment history.
Finding a job is really difficult these days, and that's largely because of AI.
The problem is magnified if you are a fresh graduate or a young working professional.
At the junior level, most jobs tend to involve grunt work. You don't need to have a high level of expertise, but you need to put in a lot of hours. That work can be easily done by AI.
In investment banking, AI can easily edit and build financial models when we make pitch books. Senior analysts and associates can then review the AI's output. This means that instead of hiring three junior analysts, banks can settle for just one hire.
That said, people shouldn't be fazed by how tough the job market is. Looking for a job has and will always be difficult.
When I graduated from Lancaster University with a master's degree in finance in 1997, I couldn't find a job in London. I had to return home to Singapore after I ran out of money. To make things worse, I had to continue my job hunt amid the Asian financial crisis.
I wasn't a standout candidate. I had no network and no special skills. The two years I spent doing foreign exchange sales at a local bank before going to graduate school didn't help me land any front office roles.
In the end, I decided to pivot and was lucky to secure a middle office role doing risk management at Standard Chartered. From there, I began to work my way to the front office, and I eventually joined UBS as managing director in 2011.
Here are my four tips for landing jobs and navigating layoffs, or what I like to call the ""CATS"" framework.
The C in ""CATS"" stands for competencies. You need to pick up skills that go beyond your current role.
When I was at Standard Chartered, I wanted to build up my skills in sales. To do that, I asked my insurance agent to sign me up for a five-day sales boot camp that was popular among insurance agents.
Later, when I was working at Citi, I picked up photography. That allowed me to become a photographer for a client's event, which helped me grow my network and build relationships.
When I worked at Citi and UBS, I offered to train my colleagues in other departments. This improved my public speaking skills and helped me secure a side gig as an adjunct associate professor of finance at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
Looking back, it was these peripheral skills that pushed my career forward and allowed me to secure job transfers from Singapore to Shanghai, and then Hong Kong.
So don't just be good at your job. Everyone is good at their jobs. It's the additional competencies that you pick up that will give you the extra edge.
The A in ""CATS"" stands for appeal. You need to make yourself more interesting because skills can become obsolete.
I decided to express my creativity by picking up art. My art pieces aren't complicated. One of my pieces was a tribute to the luncheon meat I used to eat with my instant noodles while working in Hong Kong. I sawed the cans in half and moulded them together.
Making art makes me more appealing to others. For instance, I can post photos of my artwork on social media and engage in discussions with my peers.
The third letter, ""T,"" stands for trust. You need to be trustworthy because when people hire, they don't just look for skills. They are looking for someone whom they can trust.
And in order to be trusted, you have to be consistent.
It's not difficult to achieve. I stick to the same attire of blue jackets and white shirts. I arrive early to meetings.
It's about doing the small things well. After all, if you can't even get the small things right, why would anyone trust you with big things?
The last letter in ""CATS"" stands for social capital.
If you don't have a network, you are essentially competing against thousands of people whenever you apply for jobs.
That's why you need to start building and maintaining your network. Social capital means being generous in buying people coffee or treating them to lunch. Treat your colleagues with respect, including the junior ones, because they will climb up the ranks someday.

PCs donât have to be bulky power-hogs that take over your entire workspace or super expensive to be efficient. If youâre after something that saves space while keeping up with your everyday work and play needs, there are quite a few solid mini PCs on the market. And Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab one.
The retailer has dropped the price of the Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny M70q Gen 5 PC to just $800, after a massive 64% discount. Even better, youâre not just getting the PC. This deal also includes a USB Calliope keyboard and mouse, plus Windows 11 pre-installed. Thatâs a full setup ready to go right out of the box. The deal, however, is selling fast, and thereâs no telling how long the offer or the stock will stick around. If youâve been waiting to upgrade your desktop situation for less, now is the time to act.

This is a mini PC, which means youâre getting impressive power packed in a compact, lightweight frame. It measures just about 7 x 7 inches with a slim 1.4-inch depth, so it can fit into any setup without demanding a lot of space. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can simply tuck it behind their monitor or under the table using the VESA mount support, but you will have to purchase the mount separately.
Power-wise, itâs equipped with Intel Core i5-14400T, which is a 14th Gen chip with 10 cores (6 performance, 4 efficiency) and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz when needed. Thereâs a massive 32GB RAM that keeps everything running smoothly, which can especially be helpful during multitasking. You can perform a bunch of different tasks at once without experiencing frustrating slowdowns that kill the momentum.
Storage is handled by a 1TB PCIe SSD. It offers enough space to store all that you own, from photos to videos, programs, a ton of work documents, backups, and more. You really wonât have to invest in another storage solution anytime soon. And since it’s a solid-state drive, you can also expect much faster load and boot times compared to the traditional options out there. Together, both memory and storage ensure that youâre able to access your system quickly, plus get through busy days with ease.
Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, and a wide port selection, including USB-C, multiple USB-A ports, Ethernet, and a headphone/mic combo jack. You can enjoy faster wireless connectivity, as well as expand your system by adding an external display or peripherals.

14,2025-11-13,"When OpenAI unveiled its first open-weight models in years this August, it wasn’t just tech companies that were paying attention. The release also excited US military and defense contractors, which saw a chance to use them for highly secure operations.
Initial results show that OpenAI’s tools lag behind competitors in desired capabilities, some military vendors tell WIRED. But they are still pleased that models from a key industry leader are finally an option for them.
Lilt, an AI translation company, contracts with the US military to analyze foreign intelligence. Because the company’s software handles sensitive information, it must be installed on government servers and work without an internet connection, a practice known as air-gapping. Lilt previously developed its own AI models or used open source options such as Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemma. But OpenAI’s tools were off the table because they were closed source and could only be accessed online.
The ChatGPT maker’s new open-weight models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, changed that. Both can run locally, meaning users have the freedom to install them on their own devices without needing a cloud connection. And with access to the models’ weights—key parameters that determine how they react to different prompts—users can tailor them for specific purposes.
OpenAI’s return to the open-source market could ultimately increase competition and lead to better performing systems for militaries, health care companies, and others working with sensitive data. In a recent McKinsey survey of roughly 700 business leaders, more than 50 percent said their organizations use open source AI technologies. Models have different strengths based on how they were trained, and organizations often use several together, including open-weight ones, to ensure reliability across a wide variety of situations.
Doug Matty, chief digital and AI officer for the so-called Department of War, the name the Trump administration is using for the Department of Defense, tells WIRED that the Pentagon plans to integrate generative AI into battlefield systems and back-office functions like auditing. Some of these applications will require models that are not tied to the cloud, he says. “Our capabilities must be adaptable and flexible,” Matty says.
OpenAI did not respond to requests for comment about how its open source models may be used by the defense industry. Last year, the company reversed a broad ban on its technology being used for military and warfare applications, a move that prompted criticism from activists concerned about harms caused by AI.
For OpenAI, offering a free and open model could have several benefits. The ease of access could cultivate a larger community of experts in its technologies. And because users don’t have to sign up as formal customers, they may be able to operate with secrecy, which could keep OpenAI from facing criticism over potentially controversial customers—like, say, the military.
Earlier this year, Matty’s unit at the Pentagon struck one-year deals worth up to $200 million each with OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI, Anthropic, and Google. The goal is to create prototypes of AI systems for different purposes, including automating war-fighting tools. Until OpenAI’s recent launch, Google was the only new tech partner that offered a cutting-edge open model as an option. The other companies license models that are run from the cloud and can’t be customized to the same extent as open models.
In Lilt’s case, CEO Spence Green says a military analyst may input a prompt like, “Translate these documents to English and ensure that there are no mistakes. Then have the most knowledgeable person about hypersonics check the work.” Lilt’s proprietary models, which are trained for government applications, handle the translation. Google’s Gemma currently automates routing which information goes to models, analysts, and other teams. The aim is to address a shortage of language experts and a backlog of data to process.
OpenAI’s latest open source models aren’t well suited for Lilt’s needs. They process only text, and the military needs to also sort through images and audio. Lilt also found the models underperform in some languages and in situations with limited computing power. But the results haven’t demoralized Green. “With gpt-oss, there’s a lot of model competition right now,” Green says. “More options, the better.”
Other companies that work with the military say they got good results from the gpt-oss models, but they aren’t aware of any Pentagon projects using them that have moved past the demo stage. “It’s pretty early,” says Jordan Wiens, cofounder of Vector 35, which supplies reverse engineering tools to the Pentagon and has integrated gpt-oss into its offerings.
EdgeRunner AI, which is developing a virtual personal assistant for the military that doesn’t require a cloud connection, says it achieved sufficient performance with gpt-oss after feeding it a cache of military documents to modify its capabilities, according to a paper the company published in October. The US Army and the Air Force will begin testing the modified model this month, says Tyler Saltsman, EdgeRunner’s CEO.
Open models may be particularly valuable in situations that require an immediate response or when internet interference could be an issue. That includes AI systems running on drones or satellites, says Kyle Miller, a research analyst at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Open source AI models offer the military “a degree of accessibility, control, customizability, and privacy that is simply not available with closed models,” he says.
Beyond direct deals with AI providers, the military also has access to about 125 open source models and about 25 closed options through an intermediary AI platform called Ask Sage, says Nicolas Chaillan, the company’s founder and a former chief software officer for the US Air Force and Space Force.
Chaillan says there are serious drawbacks to using open source models, particularly for the US military. They hallucinate and make incorrect predictions more often than the best commercial models, he claims. And while they are often free for most uses, the infrastructure needed to run the biggest models may end up costing the same or more than licensing a commercial model over the cloud. “It’s like going from PhD level to a monkey,” Chaillan says. “If you spend more money and get a worse model, it makes no sense.”
He believes that the military should keep an eye on open models, but focus its efforts on using the more capable options that Microsoft, Amazon, and Google offer through cloud networks developed specifically for sensitive government tasks.
Other military suppliers and experts disagree, contending that closed models can lead to dependence issues and won’t meet the boutique needs of the armed forces.
Pete Warden, who runs the transcription and translation technology developer Moonshine, says his contacts in the defense world have become more cautious about trusting big tech companies after seeing how Musk used his Starlink satellite network to influence government leaders. “Independence from suppliers is key,” Warden says. His solution has been letting government agencies control a perpetual copy of Moonshine’s model in exchange for a one-time fee.
William Marcellino, who develops AI applications for the research group RAND, says open models that can be more easily controlled would help the military and spy agencies with projects such as translating materials for influence operations into regional dialects, a task that general commercial models may struggle to execute with precision. “It’s good to have choices,” he says.

The Big Short guy is short on trust in the state of the current economy. Earlier this week, it came to light that Michael Burry, famously depicted by Christian Bale in Adam McKay’s telling of the 2008 housing crisis, is shutting the doors to his hedge fund Scion Capital because he believes the market is completely detached from fundamentals.
In a letter dated October 27 informing his investors of his plans to liquidate the fund, he wrote, âMy estimation of value in securities is not now, and has not been for some time, in sync with the markets.” The move comes shortly after Burry publicly shared that he had short positions against Trump administration-aligned defense tech firm and surveillance-state facilitator Palantir and chip giant Nvidia. On X, Burry revealed that his position has a $50 target for Palantir in 2027, despite the company currently trading at over $170 per share at the time of publication.
Burry came out of hibernation last month to speak up about what he believes to be a bubble in the AI sector, which he’s certainly not alone in ringing the alarm bells about. But Burry does have a novel angle on the matter: He believes companies are cooking the books by fudging the depreciation schedules of their chipsets, calling it “one of the more common frauds of the modern era.” Burry’s math is basically that hyperscalers like Oracle, Meta, Google, and others are claiming the useful lifespan of their tech is five to six years when, in his estimation, they are actually closer to two to three years.
That apparently pushed him to the conclusion that also ultimately led to him shutting down Scion Capital: “Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.”
The depreciation tables are a bit of a weedsy observation, but one with significant impact if Burry is correct. He shared a chart that suggests earnings from these companies will be overstated by $176 billion between 2026 and 2028, with companies like Oracle and Meta overstating their actual earnings by more than 20%. He’s not alone in this observation, either. Another short seller, Jim Chanos, pointed to cloud-based GPU provider CoreWeave as a prime example of the deprecation trick, claiming that the company is barely profitable with more accurate deprecation timelines.
Any time a short seller shares information like this, they’re met with skepticism about their motivations. Palantir CEO Alex Karp took some shots at Burry’s position against his company, for instance, saying, “As far as I can tell, the two companies he’s shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,” and arguing, “The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy.”
But these guys aren’t the only ones starting to raise questions about how exactly these AI firms, seemingly endlessly taking on investor funds and racking up massive valuations, will actually make money. Source News reported that investors on a private call asked OpenAI’s Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, why the company’s growth appears to be slowing, which she ultimately blamed in part on the dwindling time users were spending with ChatGPT following the addition of stronger content restrictions.
It’s not clear if “we’re building the erotica bot to maximize user engagement” is the kind of thing that should make the markets rest easier.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Part 2: Current State of the Housing Market; Overview for mid-November 2025
A brief excerpt: Yesterday, in Part 1: Current State of the Housing Market; Overview for mid-November 2025 I reviewed home inventory and sales.  I noted that the key stories this year for existing homes are that inventory increased sharply, and sales are down slightly year-to-date compared to last year (and sales in 2024 were the lowest since 1995). That means prices are under pressure.

In Part 2, I will look at house prices, mortgage rates, rents and more.
...
The Case-Shiller National Index increased 1.5% year-over-year (YoY) in August and will likely be about the same year-over-year in the September report compared to August (based on other data).
...
In the January report, the Case-Shiller National index was up 4.2%, in February up 3.9%, in March up 3.4%, in April report up 2.7%, in May up 2.3%, in June up 1.9% in July 1.7% and in August 1.5%.

And the August Case-Shiller index was a 3-month average of closing prices in June, July and August.   June closing prices include some contracts signed in April.

So, not only is this trending down, but there is a significant lag to this data.There is much more in the article.

Tune into an appearance from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, and it's likely you'll hear an obscure word: ontology.
The term is a favorite among Karp and his Palantir deputies. They drop it on earnings calls and in financial filings. They've said it's behind the rise of Palantir's stock, which is up over 140% year to date.
Ontology was even at the center of a spat earlier this week between the CEO and famed investor Michael Burry, who bet against Palantir.
""The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy,"" Karp said on TV, after filings revealed Burry's hedge fund had wagered against the defense tech giant.
Burry hit back on X, dropping the O-bomb twice in his response.
""A fundamental principle of any rigorous ontological/epistemological model — whether philosophical or in data science — is recognizing when your information set is insufficient for valid conclusions,"" he wrote.
Insults regarding one's ""ontological"" model are not heard every day — and for good reason.
Its technical meaning is, well, lofty. Ontology is ""the branch of philosophy that studies existence."" Think of queries like: Is the phone that you're reading this on real? Do these words exist? Do I?
It makes sense that Karp, Palantir's eccentric and wealthy leader, would be familiar with the concept. A student of philosophy, after earning a law degree and prior to cofounding Palantir, he pursued a Ph.D. in neoclassical social theory at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany.
When Karp uses the O-word, he typically refers to a component of software company Palantir's enterprise platform, Foundry, which is used to organize and analyze company data in a useful way. Launched in 2016, Foundry has played a critical role in Palantir's rise.
The company's ""Ontology"" is related to the philosophical term, at least loosely. The product is responsible for connecting a company's digital presence to its real-world one — hence the name — including its physical assets, products, orders, and transactions.
Once an Ontology is established, Palantir's tools can run. For example, a retailer could model its global supply chain and set up alerts for out-of-stock items. A utilities company might use it for predictive maintenance across tens of thousands of miles of grid wire. A life sciences company might use it to store sensitive data, as Foundry enables companies to comply with HIPAA and other relevant standards.
""The Ontology transforms your digital assets — including data, models, and processes — into a dynamic, actionable representation of the business for all users to leverage,"" Palantir's website reads.
It's a product that the company is advancing. Its new Edge Ontology can run on mobile devices, allowing customers to build apps and embedded software for drones and robots, Sankar said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in early November.
As CTO Shyam Sankar said on an earnings call in May, dropping Karp's chosen word, of course: ""Our advantage comes down to Ontology.""

Yinka Ogunsunlade has had a profitable reselling business from the very beginning.
The first item he listed and sold was a perfume set that his mom received for Christmas and wasn't planning on using.
""I saw what it sold for in the retail store, and I said, 'Let me see if I can put it up on eBay,'"" the DC-based lawyer told Business Insider. ""It was a no-cost item, so anything that I made from it would be strictly profit.""
That was back in 2005. Ogunsunlade had just started law school and was home for the holidays.
He sold the perfume ""fairly quickly,"" he said, and then moved on to listing items from his closet. ""I had way too many clothes.""
After working his way through his closet items, the next step was to start shopping at discount stores for inventory. Gradually, over the last two decades, Ogunsunlade has built a six-figure side hustle reselling shoes and clothing.
Between September 2024 and September 2025, his company, Fashionably Legal, did $120,000 in sales on eBay, according to a screenshot of his seller hub dashboard.
With this particular side hustle, the barrier to entry is extremely low, said Ogunsunlade: ""There was no startup cost."" You just have to be willing to invest time, he added: ""The more time that you put into researching items and sourcing items, the more items you can list. You see a direct return on the amount of effort that you put in.""
The eBay veteran shared where he shops, what he's looking for, and strategies he uses to ensure he'll turn a profit. 
When Ogunsunlade first started reselling on eBay, he spent hours sifting through clothing racks for deals. He said he stopped by his two ""go-to"" stores — Neiman Marcus Last Call and Saks OFF 5th — almost every day.
He still spends a couple of days a week shopping in-store, but he's shifted to doing more ""online arbitrage,"" which saves him time and gas money.
""I can just have the items sent directly to me, list them right away, and then get them shipped back out,"" said Ogunsunlade, who uses sites like YOOX and NET-A-PORTER to find great deals on luxury items. ""I'm constantly on those websites looking for different sales, refreshing pages, seeing items coming in and out of stock.""
Sourcing items is time-consuming and can sometimes feel like a grind, he admitted. But, as someone who enjoys shopping and the ""thrill of the hunt,"" he said, ""it's never seemed like work to me.""
To succeed in any category on sites like eBay, you have to pay attention to two numbers: the price of the item you plan to buy and resell, and what comparable items have sold for on eBay.
Ogunsunlade advises browsing the ""sold items"" section of your niche on eBay to figure out what is selling well and what isn't. You can also reference the sold items to ensure you'll turn a profit, rather than lose money on an item.
When he first started on eBay, as he was shopping for inventory, he'd take photos of items along with their price tags. Then, he'd drive home, pull up eBay on his computer to look for what similar items sold for, and return to the department stores to buy the ones with the best profit margins. Now, thanks to smartphones, he can look up products on the spot and decide if the margins are strong enough to purchase.
It's essential to use the ""sold items"" filter on eBay, he said, as there could be a big discrepancy between what something is listed for and what it sells for.
Having been on eBay for 20 years, Ogunsunlade has started to notice patterns.
At the start of football season, for example, he stocks up on cleats: ""Once July and August roll around, I know there's a parent somewhere in America with a kid that needs some football cleats.""
What he likes about his category, though, is that it's more resilient than others.
""Everybody's always going to need a pair of running shoes or walking shoes or less formal, athletic wear,"" he said. Whereas, with a category like business attire, there can be more of an ebb and flow. ""Especially when COVID came around, people weren't going into the office and weren't even wearing business attire, so I saw a drop in people searching for neckties and formal wear online. I don't see those types of pronounced dips in the athletic market.""
He also enjoys selling active wear the most.
""I think it's definitely beneficial to sell something that you're passionate about — not to just sell it because you can,"" he said. When selecting a category to specialize in, ask yourself: ""Do you enjoy looking at this same style, this same type of item every day?""

God forbid I ever say no to free food, and so the other day, I found myself breakfasting on a friend's abandoned protein bar that I decided it was my personal mission to save from the trash. The protein bar tasted as fine as a protein bar can, but it was also small — like, itsy-bitsy small. The package said its ingredients included a hyper-specific 1.5 egg whites and seven (7) peanuts. My wee bar wasn't an anomaly, it's part of a broader trend: The mini-fication of food.
The United States has long been known for its extra-large food portions. We've got king-size candy bars and family-size chip bags and all-you-can-eat buffets. Many restaurants put calorie counts on their menus that can serve as a PSA for diners that they really ought to take half of their meal to go. More recently, however, food has started to move in the opposite direction. Portions are getting smaller amid tighter consumer budgets, the growing prevalence of weight-loss drugs, and perhaps some corporate tomfoolery.
In the wake of pandemic-driven inflation, you may remember the uproar over shrinkflation, where brands shrank their products without shrinking their prices accordingly. But even now that price jumps have slowed, the shrinking continues. Coca-Cola is leaning into its 7.5-ounce ""mini cans"" and plans to send them to convenience stores in 2026 to be sold individually for $1.29 a pop. Pepsi is offering smaller packs for its snacks in an effort to appeal to budget- and portion-conscious consumers. Consumer packaged goods companies such as Utz Brands and Mondelēz are playing around with sizes and increasing their offers on the smaller end of the scale.
""The American consumer likes excess. They like to have the massive portions, and they like to indulge. That hasn't gone away,"" says Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director of GlobalData. ""But there is, at the other end, a more frugal mindset in terms of money and calories, and the market has shifted a little bit to serve that market.""
The shift is good in that if you're trying to save money or watch your waistline, you have more options. But this isn't a case of corporate altruism in the grocery aisle: Brands' bottom lines often get a boost from offering the smaller stuff, too.
Consumer budgets are increasingly strained (except for the richest Americans). Total credit card debt is near record highs. While households on the whole have been able to keep spending despite pressures from inflation and an anxiety-inducing labor market, many people have started to look for places to cut back.
""There's an entire segment of the population that is struggling financially, and the food budget is a prime target for cutting,"" says Rick Miller, a partner at data analytics firm Big Chalk Analytics. People have more wiggle room in their grocery bills and dining out budgets than in their rent, mortgage, or car payment.
A survey of 4,500 American consumers conducted in the first week of June by Big Chalk Analytics found that over half said they planned to cut their spending at the grocery store in the remainder of 2025. One tactic money-crunched consumers are using: buying smaller, and therefore cheaper, package sizes. Maybe someone's hesitant to spend $8 on a regular package of their favorite cookies, but they'll spring $2 for a smaller size and give themselves a little treat. Companies, for their part, are trying to satiate the appetite for smaller options.
""It meets the consumer's desire for value and to simply spend less as costs rise,"" says Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at eMarketer, Business Insider's sister company.
The most value for consumers generally means buying in bulk. On a weight basis, you'll get more bang for your buck buying a giant box of cereal or a family-sized package of chips than smaller options. That's what many wealthier consumers who can swing the Costco membership are doing.
""People are saying, 'Yeah, I've shifted. Now I buy big multi-packs, bigger family-size products that are better, I get more for my money that way,"" says John Owen, the associate director of food and retail at Mintel, a market intelligence and research agency.
Buying the 24-pack instead of the 2-pack, though, requires a larger upfront outlay. For consumers who are really struggling, that may not be an option — the price that really matters is what they see at the register, rather than the cost per unit. Manufacturers also have to cater to them. Low-income families are having to cut back on grocery spending, given the chaotic battle over SNAP benefits.
Rising health consciousness and the growing uptake of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs have also contributed to shrinking food portions and packaging. People want a 100-calorie chip bag that they can polish off without feeling too guilty, and in the era of Ozempic, it may be all that they can eat in a sitting.
GLP-1 drugs signal to the brain that you're fuller faster and slow gastric emptying, meaning ""you're getting full on smaller portions but also hungry less often,"" explains Morgan Dickison, a registered dietitian at Weill Cornell Medicine. People experiencing side effects, namely nausea, when they first start taking the medications, may consume particularly small portions. And over time, the drugs may impact what people want to eat overall. ""It's almost like interest in food in general decreases for a lot of people, and some of these highly palatable foods are just not of interest anymore,"" she says.
Food manufacturers, grocers, and restaurants are making adjustments accordingly, including introducing smaller pack sizes and upping a food's protein content (or advertising it more prominently), since protein is a vital necessity for GLP-1 patients.
""10% of the US population is on some form of GLP-1,"" says Rob Holston, the global and Americas consumer products sector leader at EY. ""Our clients are changing strategies and behaviors around it.""
People who aren't on GLP-1s are scrutinizing what they're consuming more, too, including portions. Consumers are purchasing alcohol in smaller sizes and amounts, in part to save money, but also to try to cut back on drinking overall. In its third-quarter earnings call, Mondelēz said it would look to expand its zero-sugar and gluten-free offerings in Oreos and Tate's cookies to try to appeal to health-conscious consumers. Health and wellness have been a long-standing topic of discussion in the food industry for years. Even demographics play a role.
""We have an aging population in the US with baby boomers, and as you age, you don't eat as many calories,"" says Sally Lyons Wyatt, a consumer packaged goods advisor at Circana, a market research firm.
It is not a terrible deal for food manufacturers that people are into smaller food, because profit margins tend to be higher for smaller packages. On earnings calls, many packaged food companies have talked about being able to push prices up even while sales volumes aren't increasing. One way to do that is by offering smaller packages and charging a little less for them, but not as much less as they could, or even keeping the price the same.
""Maybe the unit pricing isn't that great, but to the consumer that's hard pressed — and everyone's a bit concerned about inflation still — it's a lower opening price,"" Saunders says.
This can be risky for brands, because consumers can feel like they're being taken advantage of and being shortchanged. That's why there's been such a backlash over shrinkflation in the post-pandemic era: People take note when that pack of sports drinks they buy for their kids on a weekly basis suddenly looks a little smaller and feels a little lighter. A 2025 CivicScience survey found that 56% of Americans reported noticing that grocery packaging has been getting smaller. A Government Accountability Office report found that product downsizing accounted for less than one-tenth of a percentage point of the overall 34.5% increase in consumer prices from 2019 to 2024. However, in certain categories, such as cereal, coffee, and household paper products, it was a more significant contributor.
""Done wrong, it's brand destroying,"" Holston says. If consumers are pushed too far, they'll switch to a cheaper or white-label brand, and when that happens, they don't usually come back.
Modern-day consumer society affords more flexibility for both consumers and brands. Holston notes that 20 years ago, the average store stocked 6,000 SKUs, as in distinct products, and now it's 50,000. Offering small is a way to compete. Not only does it appeal on price, but it also gets people to try things out. ""You want to drive sampling,"" Holston says.
Just like consumers are facing financial pressures, companies are, too. Tariffs, changing regulations on ingredients, and the ongoing impacts of inflation mean manufacturers have to rejigger their product lines, too, including adjusting sizes.
""If you're trying to hit a price point that your consumers are going to pay, then how do you do that? One of the levers is indeed to change the ounces or pounds or whatever in a package,"" Lyons Wyatt says.
There are plenty of reasons consumers are leaning toward buying smaller. Some of it's saving money, some of it's saving calories, some of it's taking a smaller risk on something new, some of it's that you want to put a two-cookie snack pack into your work backpack and call it a day. The giant rise of tiny foods is upon us, because we want it and because businesses do too.
""It's just about meeting the consumer where they are and offering more flexibility and doing so in a way that also is good for business,"" Stambor says.

23,2025-11-13,"
Australian tiny house manufacturer Häuslein Tiny House Co has just launched its newest model, the Eire, marking a significant departure from its traditional multi-story designs. The new Häuslein Eire tiny house has been crafted with inspiration from Ireland (homeland of Scott, who designs all our tiny houses!), bringing a distinctly fresh aesthetic to the company’s established lineup.
Designer: Häuslein Tiny House Co.







The Eire represents a bold shift toward single-level living, featuring a single-story layout that puts the focus firmly on daylight through panoramic glazing that maximizes natural light and connection to the outdoors. This design philosophy prioritizes openness and connectivity with nature, a hallmark that sets it apart from the company’s traditionally compact, multi-level offerings.
Crafted with spacious design, vast windows, and an all-new colour palette, the Eire brings a fresh, elegant look to our tiny house range, while maintaining the same high standard in design and finish that Häuslein customers have come to expect.





 
Unlike Häuslein’s larger family-oriented models, the Eire targets a specific niche in the tiny house market. The first layout is primarily designed for guest accommodation, though the company has indicated that a possible second layout for long-term living will also be developed with customer interest.
The company has identified two primary use cases for the Eire. For Airbnb guests, the tiny house lends itself well to guest accommodation as a simpler, more cost-effective Airbnb tiny house with everything 1-2 guests may need for a very enjoyable stay. For property owners seeking extra accommodation, the Eire has been specifically designed for 1-2 family members or friends to have a very enjoyable stay on your property with their own kitchen, loft bedroom, toilet, and shower, and chill out space.


At an Introductory Special price starting at $135,080 (inc GST), the Eire positions itself as one of Häuslein’s more accessible options, making quality tiny house living available to a broader market segment. This pricing strategy reflects the model’s streamlined design and targeted functionality.
The Eire represents Häuslein’s evolution toward more specialized, purpose-built designs that address specific market needs while maintaining their commitment to quality craftsmanship. With its Irish-inspired aesthetic and focus on natural light, the Eire offers a compelling option for those seeking elegant guest accommodation or compact living solutions without compromising on design excellence.

Uber once touted itself as an alternative to car ownership. Data, however, show that over a decade into the ride-hailing revolution, car ownership is here to stayâeven in places where Lyft, Uber, and Waymo run rampant.
In 2023 Uber had a profitable yearâits first since it went public and started having to disclose its financials. SoÂ itâs worth traveling back to the early days of ride-hailing, to revisit the beautiful future proposed by at-the-time CEO Travis Kalanick. In the days when Uber had just blown up, he described his âvisionâ to the Wall Street Journal like this:
So what is that vision?… It’s a reflection of our mission to turn ground transportation into a seamless service. Basically make car ownership a thing of the past…If you just looked at San Francisco, the ground transportation market in just San Francisco — where people pay to get in a car and go somewhere, whether they own the car or otherwise — is $22 billion. No wonder we’re several hundred million in size just in SF, and growing faster this year than last year.
Uber is now a load-bearing pillar of the tech economy, and ride-hailing is now a regular feature of life, so it seems like a good time to check in on Kalanickâs vision. He seemed to be arguing that his app’s success in San Francisco in 2011 was an indication of a transition away from personal car ownership already in progress. Did his dream come true?
A brief report published Wednesday, compiled from census data, says, basically: LOL.
The data on car ownership show that not only hasnât transportation become as simple as tapping your phone, being whisked away, and never having to worry about tire rotation again, but the trends look like theyâre going a little in the opposite direction. In dense areas served by ride-hailing services, car ownership is basically flat since the birth of Uber, or even inching slightly up.
The report is from retired automotive researcher Glenn Mercer, who writes a newsletter called âCar Charts,â which is about car charts.
Looking at the crude totals without controlling for other factors, Mercer found that nationally, there were 800 cars per 1,000 Americans in 2000, and about 850 per 1,000 Americans nowâlots more cars, as anyone would probably guess.
But instead of leaving it there, he looked closely at major metropolitan areas, focusing on the census metrics that reveal the number of âvehicles available to the members of the householdâ where ride-hailing services are popular. Mercer focuses on certain representative years from 2005-2024âbefore Uber, during Uber’s rise, and the most recent year with data.
During that time, these were the changes in the chartâs raw metric, with a one-point increase or decrease basically corresponding to, âone one-hundredth of a car per householdâ:
In other words, no significant change anywhere, although the one tenth of a car increase in Dallas is somewhat eyebrow-raising.
Mercerâs analysis is that, he doesnât âsee any real impact on cars per household. Even in the Bay area, the ancestral home of All Things App, no movement.â
With that in mind, did you know the cost of the average new car in the US is now over $50,000? A 2023 report by Brookings argues that young people own fewer cars than members of older generations simply because they don’t have enough money to buy cars. A Deloitte report from earlier this year found that 44% of adults 34 and under would be willing to get rid of their cars in favor of a valid alternative.
So it seems like there was nothing wrong with Kalanickâs âvision.â It would be great. Itâs just too bad ride-hailing services havenât turned out to be the path to making it a reality. Not yet, anyway.
Gizmodo reached out to Uber for comment, and will update if we hear back.

25,2025-11-13,"The Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma, one of the greatest controllers I've ever owned, is now in stock at Amazon Renewed for an astonishing 30% discount.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Razer is my personal go-to brand for Xbox controllers, with superior controls and an ergonomic feel compared to Microsoft's official offerings, and my all-time favorite is the Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma.
This classic controller has never let me down and, in the face of being phased out by its V3 successors, is back in stock (refurbished) and is receiving one of its biggest discounts ever as it's now available for $69.15 on Amazon via Amazon Renewed.
""The Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma is an excellent controller, with arguably superior sticks and buttons than the official Xbox controller itself. The extra features sweeten the deal, with a sensitivity clutch aspect that feels almost too good to be true."" ~ Jez CordenWindows Central review:⭐⭐⭐⭐💰Price check: $99.99 at Newegg😍Alternative deal: $84.99 at Walmart (White)
 



While Razer has moved on to make more advanced controllers like the Razer V3 Tournament Edition and the Razer Wolverine 3 Pro, I will always stick with the Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma.
To paraphrase my colleague, Jez Corden's review of the Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma, its mecha-tactile action buttons and D-pad feel good to use and are so responsive that they feel like cheating.
The controller also features extra shoulder buttons and back-pedals for additional inputs, a high polling rate of 1,000Hz for reduced input latency, RGB lighting, and a Sensitivity Clutch to adjust the actuation speed of analog sticks to a user's preference.
 



Without this controller, I never would've been able to beat Xbox games like Elden Ring or titles from the Monster Hunter series, and I'm so glad it's back in stock, as my old one gave up the ghost after nearly half a decade of use.
However, this renewed stock won't last long, and new ones will be harder to find as Razer is focusing on pushing out its V3 series while leaving the V2 series behind.
So, if you want an affordable, high-quality Xbox controller you can rely on for many years to come, then I cannot recommend the Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma enough, as it's one of the best Xbox controllers I've ever used.
As part of Amazon's early Black Friday sales, you can get refurbished copies of the Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma via Amazon Renewed with a 30% discount for $69.15 instead of its $99.99 MSRP.
Considering that's $100 cheaper than the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, and half the MSRP of the Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition, that's a mighty bargain if I do say so myself.
No. It is a purely wired controller that connects to consoles and PC via a detachable USB cable.
The Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma is compatible with Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows 11 PCs.
No. All you have to do is simply connect the controller, and it will work via plug-and-play. However, there is a Razer Controller Set app available to download online that will let you customize its button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and RGB lighting.
Amazon Renewed is a program where Amazon takes stock of older products that have been refurbished, pre-owned, or opened out of their packaging, and resells them at lower prices after carefully inspecting and approving them for use.
Products sold under this program also come with a one-year Amazon Renewed Guarantee that allows customers to request a replacement or a refund.
Black Friday is set to start on November 28, 2025, and will last until December 1, 2025, when it will be replaced by Cyber Monday.

26,2025-11-13,"Nvidia continues long-term Shield TV support.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's been over a decade since the first-generation Nvidia Shield TV launched, and the company is still supporting the device with a new update for the streamer.
There are many streaming devices on the market where the company releases them, rolls out a couple of updates, and then ends support. The Nvidia Shield has been the complete opposite. The company has continued supporting the device for years. It rolled out an update around the same time last year, and now it is rolling out another update.
Nvidia detailed the update on its community forum, calling it Shield Experience Upgrade 9.2.2. There are no major new features as expected, but the company says the update addresses many quality-of-life issues reported by users and brings improved stability.
 



Nvidia says Shield and Shield Pro are now more accessible to people with disabilities thanks to new features added in the update. For example, there is a new pairing alert sound to assist users when pairing the Shield Remote and Controller in Settings. The update also adds a settings UI for accessibility timeout.
The update also brings a new Bounce Keys feature, although Nvidia has not explained what the feature actually does. The company notes in the changelog that a bug where audio would drop out when watching Disney+ content should now be fixed.
The update is rolling out widely for ""all"" Nvidia Shield users, which means it is not only for the first-generation Shield TV but also the second-generation Shield TV and the Shield TV Pro.
If you own a Nvidia Shield device, you can manually check for the update by going to Settings > About Shield > System updates, and selecting Check for updates. The changelog was posted on 12 November, and the update has already begun appearing for some users on Reddit.

27,2025-11-13,"SoftBank sells all its Nvidia shares - to invest in OpenAI

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

SoftBank’s decision to sell all its Nvidia shares has drawn sharp attention from investors already wary of overheated AI valuations.
The Japanese conglomerate sold its entire 32.1 million-share holding for about $5.83 billion, ending a position that dates back to Nvidia’s early rise as the chip industry’s leading AI supplier.
Nvidia shares slipped roughly 2% after the sale, though analysts say the move may have less to do with doubts about Nvidia and more with SoftBank’s urgent need for liquidity.
New Street Research analyst Rolf Bulk noted the sale “should not be seen” as a lack of confidence in Nvidia but rather a practical decision.
SoftBank reportedly needs at least $30.5 billion for new investments in the last quarter of the year, with $22.5 billion allocated to OpenAI and another $6.5 billion to Ampere.
The total represents more investment in one quarter than in the previous two years combined.
“We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities for investors, while we can still maintain financial strength,” said SoftBank’s chief financial officer, Yoshimitsu Goto, during an investor presentation.

“So through those options and tools we make sure that we are ready for funding in a very safe manner”
The company added that the stake sales were part of its broader strategy for “asset monetization.”
This suggests a strategic shift toward broader artificial intelligence ventures rather than an exit from the AI space itself.
Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has warned that the AI sector sits in bubble territory, though he expects any correction to unfold gradually.
Also, recent financial disclosures show Michael Burry’s Scion Asset Management has opened large option positions tied to Nvidia and Palantir.
The notional value of these positions exceeds $1 billion, signaling an apparent bet on downside risk in the ongoing AI rally.
But SoftBank also sold part of its stake in T-Mobile for $9.17 billion and raised funds through a margin loan on its ARM Holdings shares.
Insiders claim that these asset sales are simply “sources of cash” for new acquisitions, including ABB’s robotics business.
These sales and SoftBank’s $19 billion gain this quarter from the Vision Fund bolstered its growing portfolio of AI-focused holdings.
“The reason we were able to have this result is because of September last year, which was the first time we invested in OpenAI,” said SoftBank’s Goto.
SoftBank remains deeply linked to Nvidia through projects like the $500 billion Stargate data center initiative, which still depends on Nvidia’s GPUs and AI tools.

The five richest people in the world are worth nearly a combined $46 billion less Thursday afternoon due to a market sell-off spurred by dumping of artificial intelligence stocks, mixed fourth quarter results from Disney and general economic uncertainty as the longest government shutdown in American history comes to an end. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down 2.5%; the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 650 points, or 1.35%; and the S&P 500 was down 1.6% as of Thursday afternoon.
As a result, the richest men in the world saw their net worths tumble, led by Tesla's Elon Musk (down $17.1 billion) and Oracle's Larry Ellison (down $12.5 billion), according to Forbes estimates.
The next seven richest people in the world on Forbes’ Real-Time Billionaire's List also each lost billions of dollars, with the top nine losing $58.6 billion altogether by 2 p.m. EST. 
The Walt Disney Corporation, a component of the Dow and S&P 500, was among the biggest losers Thursday after missing revenue expectations, though it beat analyst estimates on earnings, and after warning of a potentially long fight with YouTube TV over distribution of its cable channels.
Disney was down nearly 8% as of just after 2:30 p.m. EST on Thursday afternoon, while Shopify, Tesla and Palantir Tech were all down more than 6%.

Warren Buffet, the 95-year-old outgoing CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, was $2.4 billion richer on the day as of Thursday afternoon, catapulting him back above the $150 billion estimated net worth mark. Buffett was the only person among the 10 wealthiest in the world with a rising net worth Thursday."

Russia’s first domestically produced artificial intelligence-powered humanoid robot faceplanted during its first public demonstration this week, underscoring the challenges Russia faces in competing with more established leaders in AI and robotics like the U.S. and China.​
The robot, named AIdol, was unveiled during a tech showcase at the Yarovit Hall Congress Center in Moscow on Monday. As the machine walked onto the stage accompanied by two handlers to “Gonna Fly Now,” the theme from the 1976 film Rocky, it waved to the audience before taking a few steps, losing its balance, and toppling over. Event staff rushed to cover the fallen robot with a black cloth and carried it from the stage, cutting the presentation short. You have to see it for yourself.
​Vladimir Vitukhin, CEO of the Moscow-based startup Idol, attributed the fall to calibration issues potentially caused by the robot’s stereo cameras being overly sensitive to the lighting conditions in the hall. “This is real-time learning, when a good mistake turns into knowledge, and a bad mistake turns into experience,” Vitukhin told attendees following the incident, according to Newsweek. “I hope that this mistake will turn into an experience.”​
The robot was later brought back onstage and managed to remain upright with assistance from handlers. Vitukhin maintained AIdol sustained no damage from the fall.​
AIdol is designed to perform three main functions: walking, object manipulation, and communication with people. The humanoid can perform up to six hours of autonomous operation, according to the company, and its face is capable of expressing at least 12 basic emotions and “hundreds” of microexpressions through its flexible silicone skin. All of the robot’s systems function offline. The video below offers a pretty good idea of what AIdol looks like up close, including its face.
According to the company, 77% of AIdol’s components are Russian-made, and it plans to raise that number to 93% when the robot eventually enters mass production. Russia, of course, faces sanctions from Western nations over the country’s invasion of Ukraine, which has restricted the country’s access to advanced electronics, semiconductor components, and other critical technologies needed for robotics development.​
Russia’s robotics sector has struggled mightily since it invaded Ukraine, when major international manufacturers exited the Russian market in response to sanctions. The country has faced ongoing challenges related to component shortages and a loss of engineering talent.​
Notably, AIdol’s less-than-ideal debut really highlights just how far behind it is compared to some international competitors. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot, for example, can parkour and manipulate objects on its own, thanks to machine learning-powered vision systems. Chinese manufacturers have also made significant advances in humanoid robots—just last week, world’s richest man Elon Musk said “Tesla and China companies will dominate the [robotics] market.”​​
Russian President Vladimir Putin has long positioned artificial intelligence and robotics as critical to Russia’s global standing and national security. In a widely quoted 2017 address to Russian students, Putin declared that artificial intelligence represents “the future, not only for Russia, but for all humankind,” warning that “whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” He cautioned that monopolization of AI technology would be “strongly undesirable” and pledged that if Russia achieved leadership in the field, it would share its know-how with other nations “the same way we share our nuclear technologies today.”​
Last February, Putin signed a 40-page decree updating Russia’s National AI Development Strategy through 2030, which explicitly cited “unilateral restrictive measures introduced by unfriendly countries” as creating new challenges for Russian AI development. The updated strategy acknowledged “the decision to restrict access to AI technologies, caused by unfair competition on the part of unfriendly foreign countries” and other barriers impeding Russia’s progress. He has said many times that Russian AI must be built on the country’s “own cultural and linguistic foundations” rather than imitating Western technologies, calling this approach “sovereign artificial intelligence.”​
The developers at Idol envision AIdol being deployed in manufacturing, logistics, and public-service areas like banks and airports. However, the company has not disclosed which specific AI system powers the robot, or when we can expect mass production to begin.​

OnePlus finally officially launched its next flagship, the OnePlus 15, today (Nov. 13). This is the first time we are witnessing an earlier-than-usual global launch, just two weeks after its initial debut in China.
The OnePlus 15 evidently looks nothing like its predecessor; it ditches the unique circular camera bump on its rear panel for a more iPhone-esque camera array, off to the left of the device. The phone features an aluminum frame with a ceramic-like feel, including completely flat edges, unlike the slightly curved OnePlus 13.
 



Under the hood, the OnePlus 15 gets the all-new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, which is said to give the phone unmatched app launch speeds while keeping multitasking smooth on the device and backing its advanced AI capabilities. Along with that, it gets a Touch Response chip and a WiFi G2 chip that is said to give the users a groundbreaking gaming experience. 
As for the display, the device comes with a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution, 1800 nits of brightness, and a massive 165Hz refresh rate. It also gets tiny 1.15mm bezels, giving users more screen space to play with.
 



Furthermore, the OnePlus 15 gets a massive 7,300mAh battery that supports 80W fast charging in the U.S. and 50W wireless charging.
OnePlus always prides itself on its cameras, and the new device gets three 50MP lenses. This includes a 50MP main camera (with a larger sensor than its predecessor and OIS), a 50MP ultra wide camera, and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens that offers 3.5x optical zoom and OIS. It also has a 32MP selfie camera, which is said to capture 60% more light, which means you won't have a problem clicking those low-light selfies.
The OnePlus 15 now features the new DetailMax imaging engine, which is said to enhance picture quality. Additionally, the flagship lets go of the Alert Slider, which is replaced by a customizable 'Plus Key.'

Out of the box, the OnePlus 15 comes with OxygenOS 16, based on Android 16, which is built on the ""Intelligently Yours"" philosophy, bringing a smarter, more AI-infused OS. It takes personalization up a notch with features like Plus Mind, Gemini-integrated Mind Space, and more.
That said, the OnePlus 15 arrives in three colorways: Infinite Black, Sand Storm, and Ultra Violet. It will be available in two main configurations, with the 12GB RAM + 256GB storage variant priced at $899.99 USD, though it's exclusively offered in the Infinite Black Color.
 



For users seeking more capacity, the 16GB RAM + 512GB storage variant is priced higher at $999.99 USD and will be available in all colorways. It is important to note that both prices are subject to change due to current market conditions.
The phone will be available for purchase in Canada starting today; however, U.S. folks may have to wait a bit longer, as OnePlus says that sales have been postponed due to the U.S. government shutdown.

PokÃ©mon Pokopia 
PokÃ©mon Pokopia is making a play for the cozy game market next year by giving us what is essentially an Animal Crossing game in the PokÃ©mon universe. You play as a Ditto that transforms into a human and attempts to spruce up an island until itâs a suitable community for PokÃ©mon. Most of these monsters look the same as they ever have, but in a new trailer, we learned the game will introduce new forms for some old PokÃ©mon, including a white Pikachu thatâs never been in the main games.
This news came as part of an extended Pokopia trailer that gave fans an overview of how Ditto will work with its growing PokÃ©mon community to create a new home for them on an abandoned island. Some of the big announcements included that Ditto can transform into other PokÃ©mon like Lapras and Dragonite to get around the island faster, the citizens of your island will give you quests that seem to fill out the mysteries of the island, and through Gameshare you can play cooperatively with others, even across Switch console generations, without each person having to own the game.Â 
But perhaps most excitingly, throughout the trailer we saw a few new forms for monsters like a moss-covered Snorlax, a graying Tangrowth that acts as the gameâs Professor, a paint-covered Smeargle, and most mysteriously, a white PIkachu that is shown powering up the street lights on the island.
This pale, droopy-eared Pikachu is called Peakychu. Itâs a female Pikachu, as you can see from her heart-shaped tail, but why does she look like sheâs ill? We donât know yet, but I want to help her however I can. Coincidentally, there was supposed to be a White Pichu in HeartGold and SoulSilver, but it was scrapped in favor of the spiky-eared variant that made it into the RPGs as an event giveaway. Given that some of these monsters’ standard forms are probably recruitable villagers, itâs good that the actual characters have some defining features. I wouldnât be surprised if these variants end up in games like PokÃ©mon Go or the RPGs as a bit of cross-promotion. At the very least, Pokopia seems to have some intriguing mysteries happening alongside all the town management. Weâll find out more about Peakychu and these other forms when Pokopia launches on March 5.

Netflix employees don't have to meet or exceed expectations as part of a formal review. But they do need to prove they're worth keeping.
The streaming company is now well known for its keeper test, where management must decide whether employees are worth keeping. On the ""Pragmatic Engineer"" podcast, CTO Elizabeth Stone described how these tests — along with promotion and compensation evaluations — replace traditional performance reviews.
""We don't have formal performance reviews,"" Stone said. ""The way we approach it at Netflix is first trying to get to something that looks like continuous, timely, candid feedback.""
A constant flow of feedback doesn't have to be negative, Stone said.
""If we're living the Netflix culture well, that's something that would be familiar and comfortable every day of the year,"" she said.
Netflix is one of many companies ditching the traditional performance review structure. In 2023, Twitter founder Jack Dorsey told Block employees that the company would start ""constantly evaluating"" employees so that they could ""part ways without delay."" Ongoing feedback is also popular with small businesses.
At Netflix, Stone said that the company has a ""safety net"" of an ""annual 360 process."" During this period, employees interface with managers to set goals, she said.
""It's not structured as an evaluation,"" Stone said. ""It's structured in the context of feedback that helps people improve.""
There are two other moments that have ""performance flavor,"" Stone said, but are not formal reviews: evaluations for compensation and promotions.
""You naturally talk about performance as part of thinking about someone's personal top of market, which is our compensation philosophy,"" Stone said.
Then there are Netflix's keeper tests, the company's cutting metric for retaining a talent-dense team. Cheick Soumaré, a former Netflix HR director, told Business Insider that cutting low performers helps maintain morale among high achievers.
The keeper test previously asked: ""If a team member was leaving for a similar role at another company, would the manager try to keep them?"" If the answer was no, Netflix said it would cut the employee and offer them ""generous severance.""
Recently, Netflix reworded its policy and added a disclaimer explaining that the keeper test may ""sound scary,"" but that Netflix encourages constant communication with managers to ""avoid surprises.""
On the podcast, Stone said that there are checks and balances for managers who are conducting keeper tests, and that the tests can also be a two-way street.
""There's a keeper test that goes from members of their team to their managers,"" Stone said. ""Do I want to stay? Am I excited about the work that I'm doing?""
The keeper test provides yet another way for employees to ask for feedback, Stone said. ""Ideally, we do that in a way that feels like normal course of business,"" she said.

Don't try to run before you can walk — or walk before you can stand.
One of Russia's first humanoid robots, known as AIDOL, toppled over in front of a crowd in Moscow during its reveal on Tuesday as ""Gonna Fly Now,"" the theme song from the movie ""Rocky,"" played in the background.
A Moscow news agency posted the video of the robot's fall after the incident.
The company, a Russian startup called Artificial Intelligence Dynamic Organism Lab, or AIDOL, like the robot's name, posted a statement to Telegram on Thursday in response to the media attention.
It then posted a follow-up video on Thursday showing AIDOL in recovery mode — a bandage on its nose and a wrap on its head.
""My team is already giving me a drip of pure electricity and cleaning the lenses on my cameras, so I can see better and handle the attention of a dozen camera flashes,"" the robot says in the video.
Humanoid robots have become a top investment category as companies like Tesla, which manufactures a 5-foot-8 humanoid robot known as Optimus, and Figure, which develops a humanoid robot named Helix, build machines to augment or even replace the human labor force.
Growing the market share of Optimus is a key parameter for Tesla CEO Elon Musk to secure his new $1 trillion pay package. After the vote to approve that package earlier this month, Musk suggested that Optimus could ""eliminate poverty."" 
AIDOL was a relative unknown in the industry before this week's viral mishap. It's helmed by Vladimir Vitukhin, who, according to his LinkedIn profile, is now based in Dubai, but has years of experience directing federal IT projects for the Russian government. He's been in charge of the company since February 2023.
On its website, AIDOL describes itself as ""the first Russian anthropomorphic robot"" incorporating AI and notes that it builds both walking and desktop versions.
The company said it was surprised by the attention it's received over the incident.
""To be honest, we are a bit puzzled by the surprise around this situation in the media,"" a spokesperson told Business Insider in an email.
""AIDOL is a startup — one of thousands globally, and still one of relatively few in Russia. We are focused on the dynamic stabilization and development of anthropomorphic robots. This is not a government initiative, nor is it funded by large corporations, but a small independent team of 14 people who have been building this robot for several years using their own funds, without external investment.""
The company said in the statement that it is among the ""most advanced"" in Russia and is on par with ""leading international efforts.""
""For example, we have created what we believe to be the first robot with full facial expressions and support for offline, context-aware dialogue,"" the company said. ""With that in mind, we find it somewhat surprising that the fact a robot from a small anthropomorphic robotics startup fell onstage has caused such concern globally. From our point of view, this is simply part of the normal process of developing cutting-edge technology.""

41,2025-11-13,"Apple was today denied permission to appeal the result of a billion-dollar lawsuit filed by UK app developers accusing the company of abusive commission levels.
The company last month lost the case and a hearing today is deciding how the damages are calculated. If the ruling stands, it is expected to end up costing Apple anywhere between £1B and £2B ($1.3B to $2.6B) – but Apple is expected to counter this with four arguments …
The lawsuit was filed back in 2023 on behalf of more than 1,500 app developers. It accused Apple of charging “abusive” commission levels on app sales and subscriptions. It argued that the company’s monopoly on the sale and distribution of iOS apps means that it is able to set its own commission levels, and that developers have no choice but to accept it.
The UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last month ruled in favour of the developers. It also found that iPhone users had been harmed, as the excessive commissions were passed on to consumers in the form of higher app prices.
One interesting note in the case is that the tribunal cited Steve Jobs saying in 2008 that Apple didn’t intend to make money from the App Store, but merely wanted a commission sufficient to cover its costs.
The next step in the case is for the tribunal to decide on a method for calculating the amount of damages due to developers and consumers.
If all of this sounds very familiar, it’s because Apple is fighting a similar battle in the EU and yesterday announced the results of a study funded by the company which it said proved that commission rates have little impact on app pricing.
The job of the tribunal today is not to put a dollar figure on the damages owing, but instead to come up with a method for calculating them. The actual sum due won’t be decided until some time next year.
However, Apple took opportunity to request permission to appeal the ruling. The UK’s legal system is slightly odd in that the losing party in a case must request permission to appeal its finding. Apple was denied permission but can now challenge this denial directly with the Court of Appeal.
Based on both prior arguments made by the company in this and other cases, and the findings of the study published yesterday, Apple likely used four arguments to support its view that the CAT reached the wrong decision.
Core to Apple’s position is the usual dispute over the definition of the competitive market. The Cupertino company argues that it does not have a dominant position, as it considers the relevant market to be “mobile apps.” Since the company holds a minority share of the smartphone market in most of the countries in which it operates, it believes it cannot be considered to have a dominant position.
Legislators, regulators and courts have generally decided that the relevant market is iPhone apps, and here Apple has a 100% monopoly on their sale and distribution. Edge cases aside, there is no way for a developer to bring an iOS app to market without selling it through the App Store.
Apple also typically points to games console commission rates as a comparator, and makes the point that the 30% headline rate is misleading because most developers don’t pay that much.
The CAT agreed with Apple that both the privacy and security provided by the App Store are important, but found this was insufficient reason to block competition in the sale of iPhone apps as there are other ways of achieving the same aims. In the EU, for example, Apple still has to review and notarize apps before they can be sold through third-party app stores.
Apple, however, argues that the same privacy and security standards cannot be met outside of the official App Store.
Apple argues that part of the value it provides to developers is the use of its intellectual property, which of course includes Xcode. The company thinks it should be entitled to recoup its investment, while the CAT appears to expect the iPhone maker to make these tools available without seeing any return.
Finally, given the results of the Apple-funded study published yesterday, the iPhone maker will for sure argue that consumers were not harmed because app prices would be largely unchanged with lower commissions.
Apple will now go direct to the Court of Appeal and ask its permission to challenge the ruling. It’s extremely likely the court will agree because this is effectively an important test case that really needs to be taken right the way through the UK’s legal system.
This piece was updated following the decision.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's the holiday season, and Google is rolling out some epic tools to help you find the perfect holiday gift, but here's the catch — with Gemini, so that you don't have to jump several hoops to find that one thing you spotted on social media or that a friend recently wore.
Google is making AI Mode do the heavy lifting for you, so users can go beyond simple two-line queries and really get into the details when describing the product they need. Users can now have conversations with AI Mode in Search, much like they would with a store employee in person, describing exactly what they're looking for instead of typing several lines.
When you ask AI Mode a shopping question, you’ll not only get results to your search query, but it will also give you the images along with a breakdown of other purchasing details like price, reviews, and inventory info, helping users ""quickly and confidently decide what to buy.""
For instance, if you need some visual inspiration, you can simply say “cozy sweaters for happy hour in warm autumn colors,” and you’ll see shoppable images. By simply asking for ""moisturizers suited to your skin type,"" you will be presented with multiple products, including insights from reviews (such as how a moisturizer feels on the skin), allowing for a quick understanding of the differences.
 



Additionally, the Gemini app will also feature these new shopping tools so you can shop even when you're chatting with the AI bot. The feature pops up when users ask a shopping-related query. Google says it will give you shopping inspiration for events like Black Friday or holiday lists, providing shoppable product listings, comparison tables, and more.


Google's Agentic AI can now find products in stock nearby, saving you the hassle of calling multiple stores and wasting your time being on hold. When you search for products ""near me"" on Google Search, select ""Let Google Call."" AI will then call local stores on your behalf to check availability, price, and promos.
You'll receive an email or text with the answers, including local inventory from the Shopping Graph. The tech giant says that this feature uses Duplex technology, ""with a big Gemini model upgrade that helps us identify the best stores to call, suggest helpful questions to ask based on the product you want and summarize the conversations into key takeaways.""

Holiday sales can be totally overwhelming with so many stores offering huge discounts, and between all that craziness, it's easy to miss out on that dress you've been wanting forever or those pair of shoes that are only on sale for a few days. But that could change, as Google's new ""agentic checkout"" feature uses price-tracking to help you get desired items within your budget.
So you can get down to the specifics by tracking an item by size, color, and desired price, and you'll be notified when the price drops on Wayfair, Chewy, Quince, and select Shopify merchants.

Buying a quality monitor usually means choosing between paying premium prices for trusted brands or gambling on unknown manufacturers that might deliver terrible color accuracy and dead pixels. LG stands as one of the most prestigious names in display technology and finding their products at bargain prices rarely happens outside of major sales events.
Amazon just launched an early Black Friday deal that brings the LG 32UR500K-B down to $199, slashed from its usual $299. This record-low pricing puts a 32-inch 4K UHD monitor from a reputable manufacturer at the same cost as generic no-name displays that flood the market with questionable quality.
See at Amazon
The 32-inch 4K UHD display lets you experience 3840 by 2160 resolution that reproduces sharp text and detailed images across the whole screen. This kind of pixel density means you can see fine details in photos, read small text without zooming and enjoy crisp lines in spreadsheets or design work. The panel expresses up to 90% of the DCI-P3 color gamut – that’s the cinema-grade color space used in professional content creation and high-end displays. You’re seeing colors that match what directors and designers intended rather than the washed-out or oversaturated visuals that come from cheaper monitors that have poor color reproduction.
HDR10 support elevates compatible content by expanding the range between darkest blacks and brightest whites. HDR takes advantage of the ability to create realistic lighting and shadow details in modern games, 4K video content, and streaming services that are impossible on flat SDR content. You’ll notice the dramatic visual immersion when watching HDR movies or playing supported games.
Built-in stereo speakers with Waves MaxxAudio save desk space and eliminate the need for separate speakers if you’re using a minimalist setup. The audio quality is also quite a step above the tinny sound most monitor speakers produce; it’s big and bold, making movies and games actually enjoyable without headphones. For video calls or casual consumption of content, this solution works perfectly.
OnScreen Control software gives quick access to monitor settings without having to fumble around with physical buttons on the back of the display. You are able to split your screen into different zones for multitasking, tune brightness and contrast with mouse clicks, and switch between preset modes optimized for different tasks.
The ergonomic stand allows for tilt adjustment that lets you angle the screen to match your eye level and viewing position. Proper monitor positioning reduces neck strain during long sessions of work and prevents glare from overhead lights or windows. The borderless design maximizes screen real estate while creating a modern aesthetic that looks clean on any desk.
Multiple connectivity options include two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort for flexibility in hooking up gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops or media devices all at the same time. You can also easily switch inputs to avoid constantly plugging and unplugging cables, which is a plus if you use the monitor with multiple systems.
At $199, you’re paying what generic 32-inch 4K monitors cost while getting LG’s established reputation for reliability.

46,2025-11-13,Michael Burry shut down his hedge fund shortly after disclosing his massive short position. Is he already bracing for a crash?
47,2025-11-13,"Things are not looking good for iRobot. Although their robotic Roomba vacuums are basically a household name, the company has been faltering financially for some time now. In 2024 there was hope of a buyout by Amazon, who were presumably keen to pull the bots into their Alexa ecosystem, but that has since fallen through. Now, by the company’s own estimates, bankruptcy is a very real possibility by the end of the year.
Hackaday isn’t a financial blog, so we won’t get into how and why iRobot has ended up here,  although we can guess that intense competition in the market probably had something to do with it. We’re far more interested in what happens when those millions of domesticated robots start getting an error message when they try to call home to the mothership.
We’ve seen this scenario play out many times before — a startup goes belly up, and all the sudden you can’t upload new songs to some weirdo kid’s media player, or the gadget in your fridge stops telling you how old your eggs are. (No, seriously.) But the scale here is unprecedented. If iRobot collapses, we may be looking at one of the largest and most impactful smart-gadget screw overs of all time.
Luckily, we aren’t quite there yet. There’s still time to weigh options, and critically, perform the kind of research and reverse engineering necessary to make sure the community can keep the world’s Roombas chugging along even if the worst happens.

So let’s say iRobot folds tomorrow. What’s likely to actually happen to all those Roombas?
Well, the good news is that there’s no reason to assume the offline mode will be impacted. So pressing the “Clean” button on the top of your Roomba will still get the little fellow working, and the basic functions that allow it to navigate around a room and end up back on its charging dock are handled locally, so none of that will change.
But if iRobot’s servers go dark, that means the smartphone application and everything that relies on it is toast. So you’re going to lose features like scheduling, and the home mapping capabilities of the newer Roombas that allow it to understand directives such as “Clean the kid’s room” are also out the window.
Looking further ahead, it also means that your Roomba isn’t going to be getting any firmware updates. This probably isn’t a big deal in a practical sense. So long as you haven’t run into any kind of show stopping bug, any future updates would probably be minimal to begin with. But there’s always a chance, albeit slim, that a security vulnerability could be found within the Roomba’s firmware that would let an attacker use it in a malicious manner. In that case, you’d have to decide if the risk is significant enough to warrant chucking the thing.
Even further ahead, replacement parts will eventually become a problem and obviously you’ll no longer be able to get any support. The latter likely won’t faze many in this community, but the inability to repair your Roomba in a few years time might. Then again, depending on what parts we’re talking about, it’s not unreasonable to think that the community could produce alternatives via 3D printing or other methods when the time comes.
If you’ve been reading Hackaday for awhile, you probably already know that the Roomba is no stranger to hardware hackers. A quick search through the back catalog shows we’ve run nearly 150 articles featuring some variant of the cleaning droid. So it will likely come as no surprise to find that there’s already a number of avenues you can explore should official support collapse.
To their credit, we should say that the success hackers have had with the Roomba is due in no small part to the relatively open attitude iRobot has had about fiddling around with their product. At least, in the early days.
As Fabrizio Branca mentions in a 2022 write-up about interfacing a Roomba with an ESP32, when he bought the bot in 2016, it even had a sticker that invited the owner to get their hands dirty. While the newer models seem to have deleted the feature, the majority of the older units even include a convenient expansion port that you can tap into for controlling the bot called the Roomba Open Interface (ROI).
So if you’ve got a Roomba with an ROI port — some cursory research seems to indicate they were still included up to the 800 series — there’s plenty of potential for smartening up your vacuum even if the lights go out at iRobot.
With a WiFi-enabled microcontroller riding shotgun, you can fairly easily tie an older Roomba into your home automation system. If Amazon has already taken over your household, you can teach it to respond to Alexa. For those looking to really push the limits of what a vacuum is capable of, you could even strap on a Linux single-board computer and communicate with the bot’s hardware using something like the PyRoombaAdapter Python library.
While this all sounds good so far, we run into something of a paradoxical problem. While the older Roombas are hackable and the community can continue updating and improving them, it’s the newer Roombas that are actually at greater risk should iRobot go under. In fact, many of the Roomba models that support ROI don’t even feature any kind of Internet connectivity to begin with — so they’ll be blissfully unaware should the worst happen.
The options right now for owners of “smarter” Roombas are more limited in a sense, but there’s still a path forward. Projects such as dorita980 and roombapy offer an unofficial API for communicating with many WiFi-enabled Roomba models over the local network, which in turn has allowed for fairly mature Home Assistant integration. You won’t be able to graft your own hardware to these more modern Roombas, but if all you want to do is mimic the functionality that would be lost if the official smartphone application goes down, a software solution will get you there.
It’s also quite possible that the news of iRobot’s troubles might inspire more hackers to take a closer look at the newer Roombas and see if there aren’t a few more rocks that could get turned over. As an example, the Valetudo project aims to free various robotic vacuums of their cloud dependency. It doesn’t currently support any of iRobot’s hardware, but if there were a few sufficiently motivated individuals out there willing to put in the effort, who knows?
In short, folks like us have little to fear should the Roomba Apocalypse come to pass. Between the years of existing projects demonstrating how the older bots can be modified, and the current — and future — software being developed to control the newer Internet-aware Roombas over the local network, we’ve got pretty much all the bases covered.
But for the average consumer who bought a Roomba in the last few years and makes use of the cloud-connected features, that’s another story. There’s frankly a whole lot more of them then there are of us, and they’ll rightfully be pretty pissed off if the fancy new robotic vacuum they just picked up on Black Friday loses a chunk of its promised functionality in a few months.
The end result may be a second-hand market flooded with discounted robots, ripe for the hacking. To be clear, we’re certainly not cheering on the demise of iRobot. But that being said, we’re confident this community will do its part to make sure that any Roombas which find themselves out in the cold come next year are put back to work in some form or another before too long.
Please fail. Please please please.  Please let this lead to some sort of legislation mandating end of life plan for all
the junk companies and stupid products that need an app and a server back end. Heck I’ll even take the PR to the general public to NOT buy this stuff to begin with.
Case in point use a regular vacuum and listen to headphones once a week like a grown up. Or like one commenter said buy a shop vac to skirt power use rules. Bigger better cheaper and waterproof.
Still have zero sympathy for anyone that bought a web server requiring vacuum robot and thought that was a great idea.
They don’t all phone home – I have an older eBay one that doesn’t. OTOH it’s too slow and noisy and gets stuck on wires so I don’t actually use it other than entertaining guests who have never seen one before!
I quit using mine after the entertainment value wore off. It took too many “invisible walls” to keep it out of trouble.
Maybe I had a newer model, but the only time I ever ran into anything like this, it was to keep the thing from getting hung up on a floor lamp’s electrical cord and I was able to use the app to create a small exclusion zone.  Worked very well.
This is ultimately the issue. You can either have a local only vacuum robot that is slightly entertaining at best, and a liability at worst. Or you can have a cloud-dependent vacuum that actually does a decent job.
My Eufy root with lidar mapping does a pretty great job, but disconnect it from the cloud and it’s back to blindly roaming around. There’s no reason for this.
Hopefully if roomba goes under it creates a market segment someone will fill for a more premium local-only mapping robot.
We have parrots and having a daily dirt patrol has made a massive improvement in our standard of living! I just hate that I know it’s reliant on servers that WILL go down some day.
Not gonna lie, looking forward to all the scrap roombas at discount prices on eBay if they do fail …
Yeah, my cat wants one for Christmas
“…those millions of domesticated robots…”
Like, they were feral before?
But, take off their leashes and they could be feral again.  Maybe it’s a good thing the front door threshold will trip them up.
For folks who are not familiar with “corporate hospice care,” there is almost always a process called an “asset sale.” Often there are companies standing in line to offer maintenance services for existing products. So the notion that “phoning home” will soon fail, well, let’s just say it is far too soon to despair.
That makes me despair more. How they’ll segment the app more monetarily and collect more data (although if iRobot isn’t already selling a ton of data I’d be surprised)
Other than the initial rush of ‘oh that’s neat’ feelings, why does anyone think these are a good idea?
Do people live in a clean-room, where a teaspoon of dust accumulates in their entire house every year?
I have to empty my full sized vacuum every week. It has a volume of almost double the entire Roomba, not just the little dirt tray.
It is literally less work to do the cleaning yourself than to constantly have to clean out one of those dumb little robot vacuums. And it’s faster too.
Are people buying them and not using them or something? Because every single person I know that has bought one, has just switched back to cleaning things themselves within a few months and regrets buying it.
Who are these millions of robot vacuum users?
Many of them have self-emptying compartments in the base station now, so their capacity is closer to a stand-up vac.
My floors are perpetually grody from cat litter, pine needles, and general “live in the country, it’ll be fun” dirt. Nobody in our house has the surplus capacity to vacuum more than perhaps weekly. If I could spare the cash, I’d drop the money on a self-emptying, self-charging, web-enabled-but-hackable turtle-vac without too much thought.
Absurdly priced sent me to look at other companies offering.
Found a good one, bought it, happy with it.  Price your stuff beyond what people are willing / able to pay and off you go…
Even more ewaste from people who don’t know about hacking these or don’t want to. I’m already planning on how to keep my grandparents from tossing theirs if this comes to pass.

AMD’s share in the desktop CPU market continued to increase during the third quarter, a market researcher reported, while Intel’s decision to pull back in the low end of the mobile market left the two players relatively stable. 
A report by Mercury Research said that third-quarter shipments in the x86 market were well below seasonal growth, though that was due to lower Internet of Things and SoC shipments, which had climbed significantly in the second quarter. Mercury reserved the specific numbers for its own clients.
Factoring out the IoT and SoC impact, however, AMD’s market share of the x86 market compared to Intel grew slightly, up 1.6 percentage points to 25.6 percent of the market. Intel retained the remaining 74.4 percent. Arm’s total share (including servers) versus all x86 shipments is estimated at 11.6 percent, up from 10.9 percent in the second quarter, analyst Dean McCarron wrote.
“ARM activity was modestly higher in client, mostly due to Apple’s growth in the third quarter and what we think was a slight increase in ARM based Chromebook units,” McCarron said.
AMD’s share in the desktop PC market has continued to soar, helped by its Ryzen X3D product lineup, which has outperformed Intel’s own chips. That trend continued, as the company gained 4.9 percentage points versus the same period of last year, and now controls a third of the desktop market (33.6 percent), Mercury found.
During Intel’s third-quarter earnings report, the company told Wall Street that it was lowering its emphasis on delivering “small core” or low-end products for the PC and focusing more on silicon for servers. That had an impact on Intel’s mobile share.
“Intel did manage to increase shipments, but well below seasonal levels and nowhere near the pace that AMD had, so Intel lost share to AMD in mobile processors,” Mercury’s McCarron wrote.
That still leaves AMD with about 20 percent of the market, the traditional ratio between the two companies. The company holds 21.9 percent of the market, slipping 0.4 percentage points from last year. Intel commands 78.1 percent of the mobile PC market, Mercury found.

Nobody could have predicted the turbulent state that console gaming is in right now.
Five years ago, Sony and Microsoft both launched next-gen consoles with very similar PC-based architectures. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X (and its less-powerful sibling, the Series S) promised even bigger and more realistic gaming experiences with near PC-quality graphics and responsiveness. We were told that ray tracingâthe recreation of realistic lighting, reflections, and shadows in gamesâwould be worth spending $500 for a new box to plug into our 4K TVs.
On the fifth birthday of both consoles, I can tell you we were sold a lie. Jaw-dropping as ray tracing is, few games even support the graphics enhancement. Out of the more than 1,050 games in the PS5âs library, only 60-something games support ray tracingâthatâs a measly 6%. As disappointing as that is, the PS5 has emerged as the winner against the Xbox Series X, outselling Microsoftâs game console by a huge margin. As of November 2025, the PS5âs crossed 84 million units shipped globally since 2020, versus the estimated 30 million that the Xbox Series X/S in the same amount of time.
Where Microsoft has fumbled again and againâtrying to turn Xbox into the âNetflix of gamingâ with Game Pass, pivoting to a larger publisher by buying Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion, and hiking hardware prices multiple times because of an internal mandate to turn a 30% profitâSony has expertly navigated the same industry challenges with smart expansions for its PlayStation brand.
Thereâs no telling what will happen in the future, but looking back at the past five years of PS5, itâs clear that Sony did good by gamers. Really f*cking good, for the most part.
Iâll admit that when I first saw the PS5, I was not into its curved panels or its massive size. Consoles are supposed to get smaller and more powerful, not largerâshrinkage is an easy and visible marker of technological progress. The original Xbox was disliked (especially in Japan) because it was such a behemoth. But it seems the PS5 design was just right, at least compared to the Xbox Series X, which is literally just a plain-looking black box. So out of the gate, Sony shipped hardware that looked like it was from the futureâpeople really love gadgets that look materially new and different.
As the games (and exclusives like Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Final Fantasy VII: Remake) rolled in, it became more certain to me that the PS5 was the better hardware for the long run. Though my launch-day PS5 only had 825GB of built-in SSD storage, it could easily be expanded with a standard M.2 NVMe SSD. The Xbox Series X has a proprietary storage expansion slot on the back, but for many years, only Seagate sold them, and they were really expensive. Sony chose the less evil path, and gamers like me appreciate that openness.
Even better than an affordable way to add storage to install the ballooning size of games were two hardware features I didnât think would leave any long-lasting impression on me: the adaptive triggers in the DualSense controller and the âTempest 3D audio.â Adaptive triggers provide more nuanced haptic feedback, like the ability to feel the resistance of a car gear pedal in Gran Turismo 7, the tension when pulling back a bow in Horizon: Forbidden West or switching a weapon in Resident Evil Village, or even the different surface materials in Astro Bot. Adaptive triggers add another layer of sensory immersion. Tempest 3D audio is less known, but almost every PS5 game supports it. Using a compatible headset, you can hear subtle sound effects like footsteps, gunfire, and rain (to name a few) coming from different directions. It works so well and is so underrated, but it really heightens things in the thick of a game. I never used a gaming headset with my consoles before, but on PS5, I almost always do.
The evolving nature of gaming also means itâs not enough for Sony (or anybody) to launch a console and just get as many games on it as possible. Those days are long gone. So Sony tried things; weird things that didnât necessarily become big hits, but Iâm still glad it took a stab at them because itâs kept the PS5 from aging out.
Peripherals like the PlayStation VR2, a second-generation version of the PSVR for PS4, opened up the console to more VR games and a 2D virtual screen to play PlayStation titles on. The PlayStation Portal, while not a standalone handheld on its own, let players stream their PS5 to it over Wi-Fi for remote play away from the console. A free software update has expanded the Portalâs functionality to allow streaming PlayStation games directly from the cloud instead of from a PS5. Sure, the PSVR 2 is largely a failure and the Portal doesn’t really compete with the Switch 2 or any handheld PC, but they gave the PS5 a moat. The Xbox Series X had no such thing.
The full-on hardware refresh with the slimmer PS5 and the more powerful PS5 Pro in 2024 has no doubt helped prop up the console as it enters its midlife. Does it suck that Sony hiked up prices for the PS5 and PS5 Pro a year later because of Trumpâs nonsensical tariffs? Absolutely, but that doesnât seem to have hurt PS5 sales as much as it has hurt Xbox Series X sales.
Iâll get to Sony bringing its PS5 exclusives to PC and what that means for PlayStationâs future in a second, but the one thing the company deserves more credit for is expanding the PlayStation brand beyond the console hardware.
A PlayStation will always primarily be a console that sits under your TV first, but itâs now also a family of devices that orbit it and any gaming PCs that can play its exclusive titles. Unlike Microsoft, which has leaned into Xbox being a service that can be played on any device, Sony sees PlayStation as an ecosystem and lifestyle gaming brand. In that way, itâs becoming more like Razer, which sells its own Blade gaming laptops, but also sells the peripherals designed for them.
When Sony announced its Inzone PC gaming brand of gaming headsets and monitors, which also worked with PS5, I knew it was only a matter of time before we got more. You didnât need 20/20 vision to see that the Inzone products were heavily inspired by the PS5âs white and black design language.
Inzone and PlayStation are still separate gaming brands today, and theyâre serving both PlayStation and PC gamers. The PlayStation Pulse Elite headset and Pulse Explore wireless earbuds are made for PS5, but theyâre also compatible with PC gaming. Same goes for the 27-inch PlayStation Gaming Monitor with DualSense Charging Hook, FlexStrike wireless fighting stick, and the Pulse Elevate portable desktop speakers, which are all coming out in 2026.
This vast and growing ecosystem of PlayStation hardware only deepens and entrenches the platform as a place worth buying into. Like a sports team, consumers root for the companies and platforms they feel the general managers are growing. Sony is winning physical and psychological mindshare with PS5- and PC-compatible hardware, while Microsoft is… apparently trying to compete with TikTok and movies. In trying to make every device an Xbox, Microsoft has lost its focus on what console gamers craveânew consoles and the accompanying peripherals to make games more enjoyableâwhereas Sony has only doubled down on core gamers.
Itâs such a strange thing to see once-exclusive Xbox games like Forza Horizon 5 and Gears of War: Reloaded on PS5, and Halo coming to Sonyâs console in 2026. These franchises used to be fodder for taking sides, but not anymore. Now that Microsoft has prioritized publishing its games on as many platforms as possible, thereâs almost no reason to be loyal to Xbox.
Time will tell whether chasing profits from games was worth sacrificing Xbox consoles at the altar, but Sony is facing the same challenge of rising game development costs. Bigger AAA games with more detailed graphics cost more money to make than ever beforeâhundreds of millions of dollars. So it only makes sense that publishing a game on as many platformsâeven a competitorâsâis a more sustainable business model.
The difference is that Sony is not handing out its games to PC before it has milked them out on PS5 first. Well-reviewed games like Marvelâs Spider-Man 2 released on PS5 in October 2023, but only on PC in January 2025, and Ghost of Tsushima: Directorâs Cut came out on PS5 in 2021, but on PC in May 2024. Even remastered versions of old titles like the PS4âs God of War, launched first on PS5 in May 2021 before arriving a year later on PC in January 2022.
This friendliness for publishing its games for PC and even making so much PC/PS5-compatible hardware has many thinking that Sonyâs taking steps to follow Microsoft and become an all-platform publisher, but thatâs just not going to happen. In case all the PS5 peripherals didn’t make it clear, the first and main platform that Sony wants gamers playing its games is on its own PlayStation consoles. PC is not an equal citizen; itâs second-class. Sony is only publishing its games on PC to recoup losses (if a game bombs) or gain additional revenue later (once PS5 sales have tapered off). Remember that most of the work of porting a game from PS5 to PC has already been done, thanks to the similarities in x86 system architecture for both platforms, so itâs more cost-efficient than it would have been pre-PS4 era.
Looking ahead, Sony is in a good position to launch its next-gen PlayStationâletâs just call it the PlayStation 6âin a few years and cruise to victory. Rumors suggest that the PS6 could launch in 2027 or 2028, which would be in line with past console lifecycles; the PS5 launched seven years after the PS4. Microsoft says it’s committed to premium Xbox hardware, which is expected to launch around the same time, but with all the missteps it’s made, the Xbox faithful may not pull up.
It also doesnât help that Sonyâs PS6 could resemble the Nintendo Switch 2 with a hybrid design that can go from console to handheld and vice versa. Or if the PS6 is a traditional console and a separate handheld, that could be concerning, too. Such a hardware departure could leave whatever Microsoft has planned for its Xbox Series X successor looking outdated if it also doesnât have some handheld component.
Sonyâs biggest threat isnât a new Xbox or the Switch 2âitâs Valveâs newly announced Steam Machine thatâs launching in early 2026. The 6 x 6-inch console is basically a tiny gaming PC that runs SteamOS, which means it can play your full library of Steam games. Tech specs and first impressions from the media show the Steam Machine is a capable enough 1080p and 1440p gaming box, but it may fall short of the performance from the PS5 Pro. Specs-wise, Sony has the edge now, and will for sure eclipse the Steam Machine with the PS6, but itâs not just Valveâs box that it will have to compete with. The same way the Steam Deck opened the door to bigger and more powerful handheld PCs to the point where the market quickly became saturated, the Steam Machine will be a blueprint for third-party companies, big and small, to launch their own SteamOS-based consoles. Whenânot ifâthat happens, Sony will face assault from more directions than it ever has.
Game exclusives and an expanding hardware ecosystem helped catapult the PS5 to the top and leave Xbox maimed and confused. Itâs also something that Sony shouldnât lose sight of for the PS6 and beyond. A steady stream of exclusives always sells new hardware. Itâs always been this way and always will be. Just look at Nintendo. Mario, Zelda, and PokÃ©mon carried the Switch to over 150 million units shipped worldwide, and itâs going to do the same thing for the Switch 2, which is already breaking records. If the PS6 isn’t as successful as the PS5, it’ll be because there aren’t enough exclusive games.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp said being a billionaire has its perks, including giving his childhood dog a final resting place closer to home.
""One of the crazy things about having resources is you can do things that mean a lot to you,"" Karp told podcaster Molly O'Shea during an interview that was posted on Tuesday.
Karp said he secured an agreement that allowed him to exhume the remains of his childhood dog, Rosita, from the Philadelphia home where he grew up.
The Palantir CEO said that ""through all sorts of ways,"" he got in touch with the person who bought the house, ""and the person was very generous and, for lots of reasons, agreed to have me exhume their whole yard.""
Karp's efforts to secure Rosita's remains are also part of a series of anecdotes journalist Michael Steinberger wrote about in ""The Philosopher in the Valley: Alex Karp, Palantir, and the Rise of the Surveillance State,"" a new biography about the Palantir CEO that came out earlier this month. Steinberger wrote that it was one of the more unique ways Karp decided to spend his fortune after the defense and data company went public in September 2020.
Karp is estimated to be worth over $17 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. His net worth has grown by $10 billion since January, buoyed by Palantir's rising stock price.
Steinberger wrote that the university professors who owned Karp's childhood home ""initially balked"" at his request. Ultimately, they agreed, he wrote, and ""Karp subsequently made a donation to the university where they taught."" Business Insider reached out to Palantir for more information about the arrangement.
Karp fondly recalled his family's beloved pet during his interview with O'Shea. He said that it was clear from the moment the Karp family encountered the dog in the pound that she would fit right in.
""There's this dog that is — and the person screaming, 'I hate this dog. I hate this dog,'"" Karp said. 'And then my mom said, 'Well, why do you hate the dog?'""
The dog, which they later named Rosita, had found a way to break out of its cage, Karp said, as well as sometimes opening the locks on other cages.
""And then my mom was like, 'That's our dog,'"" Karp recalled.
Karp said Rosita fit right into the family, which he lovingly described as ""a total freak show."" Karp's mother, Leah Jaynes Karp, is an artist, a background that the Palantir CEO has credited with influencing the direction of his company.
""Rosita played a tremendous role in our life,"" the Palantir CEO said. ""It was more like, she's very, very high IQ. It was honestly more like a human than a dog.""
Other CEOs and tech industry titans have long gushed about their dogs. For years, Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff had his dog Koa on the executive board as ""chief love officer."" Until 2015, Yelp's unofficial mascot was Darwin, the dog of CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made his dog, Beast, a Puli, his own Facebook page with public figure status. Not to be outdone, Elon Musk briefly crowned his Shiba Inu, Floki, as CEO of Twitter.
""He's a great dog, very alert, and it's hard to get anything by him,"" Musk said during a live Twitter Space in 2023.
Karp is well known for his outspokenness — and his eccentricity. He does daily tai chi and keeps pairs of swim googles in his office. He sometimes works in his barn and pursued a Ph.d in philosophy.
""Yeah, there's a lot in the book I probably wouldn't have told,"" Karp said, when asked about the exhumation of Rosita's remains.
According to the book, Rosita is now buried at Karp's home in New Hampshire. The CEO has previously said that he enjoys cross-country skiing, often near his home in the Granite State.
""I took Rosita, and, yeah, now I have her burial site near my home,"" Karp said, adding that ""Rosita was the best.""

58,2025-11-13,"Earlier this year, Satechi introduced its OntheGo collection. As the name implies, it was a collection of travel-focused accessories designed to simplify your tech life on the go. They release charging bricks, 3 1 folding chargers, trackers, and a few other goodies. Now they are expanding that collection with the introduction of the 7 in 1 MagSafe Multiport adapter. As someone who uses their iPhone for everything from video to gaming to communicating to podcasting, this new accessory has been a great addition to the travel pack. Here is what you need to know.
Now, the name is a mouthful, but the function is perfect for most situations. It’s about the size of a hockey puck and lighter than a deck of cards. So it’s extremely easy to throw into a bag or a pouch. It also utilizes MagSafe to attach to the rear of your iPhone, so you don’t have something just dangling from your phone. The 7 in 1 includes:
Since it does have a magnetic base, it also includes a magnetic adhesive ring if you want to put it on the rear of your MacBook or even your iPad. 
I have been able to test this hub over the last 10 days, and it has been great. It all starts with the build. As I mentioned, it features a magnetic base, but a nice detail is that it rotates very smoothly, which is great because it comes with a high-quality braided cable that unwinds from the base to then plug into the iPhone. Once plugged in, there is a small LED indicator to let you know that the hub is on and connected. So the package is nice and compact. 
The ports I used most frequently were the SD card slot and the USB-A port for an external SSD. I would take photos and videos with my Sony a6100, then remove the SD card and plug it into the iPhone, while having my Lexar SSD connected. Then I could easily transfer the SD card files to the SSD without the file ever taking up space on my iPhone. It’s fantastic and so helpful, especially since I don’t have to play file management gymnastics to load anything on and off the iPhone. A little trick is to pair it with Kuxiu’s B10 power bank because it has MagSafe magnets on both sides. So it can charge your iPhone and still magnetically attach the Satechi hub!
The HDMI port and Ethernet ports I used less frequently, but it is nice to know that they work as intended. I also bring this in my everyday carry so I can use it alongside my iPad Pro to do all the same functions. 
If you are in the market for a USB-C hub that is purpose-built for the iPhone but also just happens to work with your other USB-C-enabled devices, like your iPad and MacBook, then I think this one is worth considering. It’s well built, has the main ports that 90% of people are looking for and fits in any travel pack. 
The OntheGo 7-in-1 Multiport Adapter is available today in space grey on Satchi’s site and on Amazon. It is $59.99. Let me know what you think. Is this something you would use? Are you on the market for a USB-C hub for your iPhone? Let’s discuss below.

59,2025-11-13,"The White House said SNAP benefits will be paid out after the shutdown ends.
Food banks and pantries have been experiencing historic demand since SNAP benefits halted on Nov. 1 for many Americans due to the federal government shutdown.
That halt affected nearly 42 million Americans, many of whom are older or low-income, and use benefits to help pay for groceries and other essentials.
President Donald Trump late Wednesday night signed a funding bill to end the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt earlier said that full SNAP benefits will be paid out once the shutdown was resolved.
However, food assistance workers said the restoration of food assistance can't come soon enough as they struggle to fill in the gap left behind by SNAP.
Cyndi Kirkhart, executive director at Facing Hunger Food Bank, said she's been working at the food bank for 11 years and has never seen the surge in people she is seeing now, and that it is higher than what she saw during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Facing Hunger Food Bank -- which serves 17 counties in West Virginia, Ohio and eastern Kentucky -- said some locations in the southern part of West Virginia have seen a 1,800% increase in the number of families visiting.
""Typically, we do mobile pantry distribution, which are cars [lining] up [and] we load their car up with food,"" she told ABC News. ""At the most, we'll see 250 families. The past week, solidly, we have seen 900 families at each distribution, at each site.""
Kirkhart said their mobile pantries have seen such demand that instead of sending large box trucks to load up supplies at the food bank, she has had to send tractor-trailers. She added that she only has two tractor-trailers, which puts a lot of pressure on drivers to load up and visit multiple distribution sites.
Kirkhart said her organization encourages individuals to go to the food pantries for food rather than the bank, but they will still serve people who visit the bank.
""We'll still have maybe, over the course of a month, 50 people that will show up directly at the food bank for an emergency food box,"" she said. ""And these past two weeks at least, we have had 60 a day. ... It's non-stop.""
In Washington state, food banks are also seeing an exponential increase in visitors. Jordan Beaudry, development and communications manager at North Help Line -- which provides emergency services including food aid -- said there has been a surge at the two food banks the organization serves that has been years in the making.
Starting in 2022, ""we saw our numbers practically double overnight, and it's just been a steady increase since then,"" he told ABC News. ""We're serving twice as many folks as we did three years ago, and that is sort of setting the stage going into this latest round of SNAP  cuts and the government shutdown. ... We've seen just a massive increase in the amount of folks accessing services, particularly since the pause on SNAP benefits.""
The most recent demand began in October, when it was first announced that SNAP benefits may be halted in November, Beaudry said.
From July through September, the banks saw an average of 1,086 visitors per week for the first two weeks of the month, according to data provided by Beaudry. In October, the average for the first two weeks was 1,136 per week. Last week, the banks saw 1,329 visits.
At one of the food banks, Beaudry said the last Thursday in October was the highest number of people the organization has ever seen on a Thursday, with about a 14% increase in households visiting to receive food.
Similarly, Kristen Wild, president and CEO of hunger relief organization Operation Food Search, which serves 25 counties in Missouri and Illinois, said the pantries, shelters and community sites where the organization's supplies are distributed are seeing increases in people visiting between 30% and 50%.
She described a distribution event last week during which Operation Food Search had prepared 700 meals to issue starting at 10 a.m. CT. An hour before the event, the line of cars was 500 long and more than 200 families had to be turned away.
""We've had agencies report to us that they have had to shut down earlier than their typical operating hours because they have run out of food,"" she told ABC News. ""We're seeing agencies are being approached by people looking for food who've never needed to use a pantry in the past because the SNAP benefits were sufficient enough for them to get the food resources that they needed.""
The organization also runs a metro market program, which is like a mobile grocery store, that has seen a surge in customers.
The program charges for food at or below cost but has recently started issuing $15 vouchers to customers due to the increase in demand, Wild said. Workers have also had to replenish shelves multiple times throughout a two-hour metro market stop due to the increase in traffic.
Wild added that 90% of food assistance comes from federal programs like SNAP and about 10% comes from food banks and food pantries. The halt in SNAP benefits has forced food banks to go into ""overdrive"" to make up as much of the gap as possible.
""We've had terrific community support, both in terms of more food donations, more financial donations, so we can purchase more food, but we can't make up for the full SNAP gap,"" she said.

In his weekly column, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.
Last night, I lay in bed playing Lumines Arise til my arms started to ache from holding my Steam Deck in the air. This afternoon, I placed my Meta Quest 3 on my head and seamlessly continued my progress in the game, this time with an unparalleled sense of immersion that my Steam Deck could never hope to offer.
It's this type of hybrid play-as-you-please gaming haven that Valve planted the roots for when it launched the Steam Deck several years ago, which is now entering the blooming stages as the Steam Frame launches in early 2026.
The Steam Frame, as the new VR headset is called, is a standalone ""Steam Deck for your face"" that plays VR and non-VR games alike. It doesn't care how you want to play games or what you want to play; it just wants you to play them everywhere and gives you full access to the Steam library you already own, making it a powerful addition to any gamer's household.
 



Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Android Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.
 



The real beauty in products like the Steam Frame isn't inherently the hardware, although PC Gamer's hands-on delves into Valve's engineering mastery and what makes this headset stand out from the rest. No, the real draw here is the versatility of the Steam library.
When I finish a long day of work but recognize that I need physical exercise or movement and not another few hours of sitting on my butt, picking up a Steam Frame and playing a great VR game may just be the answer. Other times, I might want to wind down for the night in bed with a round of Peglin or solving some puzzles in Islands of Insight on my Steam Deck. No matter what, Steam has my back.
For me, it's this versatility that matters most. Sony is close to having a similar ecosystem with the PS5, but the company falls short in several ways. The PSVR 2 requires a cord to work, online multiplayer requires a monthly paid subscription, and Sony's digital games purchasing policy is squarely anti-consumer. Valve's ecosystem suffers from none of these issues.

Like the Meta Quest, Valve's game purchase and return policy is second to none. Don't like a game or want to return it for any reason? You have two weeks from the purchase date or two hours of ""trial play,"" whichever comes first. It's great, and it makes me feel good about spending money on digital games that I'll never have the chance to sell.
The PS5 has the ability to play physical games, but many games only get digital distribution, particularly the indie titles I enjoy playing most, meaning this isn't a situation where the PS5 has a full advantage.
The obvious upside of an all-digital library is that I can play my games on any hardware I want, which is something Steam is particularly well-suited for. The Steam OS that runs on Steam Deck and Steam Frame is built to play any Steam game, even ones made for X86-based PCs. The only real hamstring is the hardware power, which will require you to use a PC or cloud service to stream more detailed games.
Valve even thought of that when building the Steam Frame, as it includes a dedicated streaming USB stick in the box. This stick enables not only Wi-Fi 6E-grade wireless bandwidth, but it also uses a dedicated antenna on the Steam Frame to stream your PC games wirelessly to the headset. That ensures you never run into network traffic issues on your home network since it bypasses that completely.
The Meta Quest 3 can also stream any Steam game from your PC to the headset, including using a dedicated wireless streaming box like this one I've been testing for months, but the Quest wasn't purpose-built for this and doesn't provide the same ultra-high quality streaming that Steam Frame can.
 



What's more is that Steam Frame can sideload Android APKs just like the Meta Quest series can. Steam Frame isn't running Android, but Valve's unique Proton and FEX emulation layers allow it to run Android apps and games just as well as it can run Windows apps and games, something that gives the Frame a unique position in the market.
Samsung's recently released Galaxy XR headset can also run Android apps natively since it uses the Android XR operating system and has a unique advantage in that area since it comes with Google services built in. Some apps don't work at all without Google services, which is why this sort of thing never caught on with Meta Quest owners despite its ability to run Android apps natively.
 



Now that I've brought up the Quest 3, it's important to take a look at the two of them side-by-side and see which one is more worth your money. The biggest issue right now is that we don't know the price of the Steam Frame, although Valve says it's aiming to come in at under the $999 price of its previous headset, the Valve Index.
So we'll throw price out the window for now and just look at the biggest experiential differences between the two systems. The Meta Quest 3 is purpose-built for VR and mixed reality games. Meta owns just over half a dozen game development studios and uses them to pump out AAA VR games like Batman: Arkham VR, Deadpool VR, Asgard's Wrath 2, and even helps fund titles like Assassin's Creed VR, Thief VR, Metro Awakening, and more.
Valve doesn't fund any VR game development and isn't even making a new VR game, which means the latest and greatest is still the 5-year-old Half-Life: Alyx. That also means we're not getting Portal VR, Counter-Strike VR, Team Fortress VR, DOTA VR, or any other Valve IP I forgot about. If you want AAA VR gaming, the Meta Quest is the obvious headset to buy.
If you're more interested in modding VR games like Fallout 4, Skyrim, or just playing VR Chat with the Steam Frame's built-in eye tracking, Valve's headset might be right for you. With a 144Hz display and lighter build, the Frame is designed with PCVR games in mind from the start. Valve calls it a ""streaming-first headset"" because it recognizes that Steam VR players primarily use the platform to play visually complex games, something a standalone system cannot compete with.
But that doesn't mean it can't play these VR games without a PC. The company hasn't offered long enough play sessions to make an opinion on this yet, but my guess is that most PCVR games will run fine enough on the Frame in local processing mode, so long as you turn the visuals down. For someone like me, that's just fine. I use a Steam Deck because I prefer the ability to play anywhere I want. Graphics simply aren't high on my list of priorities.
 



Both Valve and Meta have crafted headsets that are designed to be modular, but the Steam Frame seems like it'll win a competition in this area. The front module of the Steam Frame can be easily removed, which contains the lenses and all computing elements. It's just 190g for that module since there's no battery inside, ensuring this headset can be used for years to come without having battery issues.
Valve also designed the controllers to be a fascinating hybrid of a traditional gaming controller and VR motion controllers. Time will tell if this was a good idea or not, but the company says, ""We see it just as a new way to play your entire Steam library,"" which makes this decision a lot more sense. Given that controllers are easily mappable natively in Steam, this should work nicely for VR titles, too.
The problem here is that the Steam Frame only has black and white passthrough vision out of the box, while the Meta Quest 3 has full color passthrough. That means there's no chance you'll want to play non-VR games on a Steam Frame while seeing your room, and that's going to be a huge disadvantage for Valve until a color passthrough add-on is sold. Yes, Valve made a port for camera add-ons on the headset.
 



Whether or not Steam Frame gives PCVR a development boost is up in the air, but it may not take much to move that needle. The Steam Deck, as popular as it seems, has only sold around 5 million units to date, yet it has significantly influenced the world of PC games development in a way that prior PC handheld hardware didn't.
Regardless of its influence over the PC VR space, I'm excited to play hybrid VR titles like Lumines Arise on this. Being able to play the same game in my bed with a Steam Deck before going to sleep or be fully immersed in it with a Steam Frame is an incredible value proposition, and it makes my Steam library feel even more valuable than it already did. I can't say the same about any other gaming ecosystem on the market.
The Steam Frame is a new standalone VR headset from Valve, designed to play both VR and non-VR games from your existing Steam library. It is expected to launch in early 2026.
Valve has not revealed exact pricing for the Steam Frame, but the company is aiming for a price below $999.
The Steam Frame is designed to be modular. The front module, which contains the lenses and all computing elements (but no battery), is removable and is very light at just 190g. This modular design is intended to extend the product's lifespan.
Yes, the Steam Frame can run Half-Life: Alyx by streaming from a PC using an adapter. The streaming stick that ships with the headset uses a dedicated wireless antenna that aims to deliver the best wireless streaming quality from your PC and uses foveated rendering to deliver the highest resolution and bit rate possible.
Yes, while Google Play Services isn't officially available on the Steam Frame, Android apps and games can be sideloaded to the headset and run via Proton and FEX emulation layers.

63,2025-11-13,"Grayscale Investments, the company behind the Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC) among other exchange traded funds, filed to sell shares on the New York Stock exchange, joining the wave of crypto companies that have become publicly traded this year.
The company, a subsidiary of crypto-focused venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG),  filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. The number of shares and proposed price range for the offering has not yet been determined. DCG would retain control of the company after the listing, according to the document.
The Stamford, Connecticut-based asset manager was at the forefront of the long march toward getting spot bitcoin ETFs approved in the U.S., suing the SEC over its rejection of the application to covert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust into an ETF.
""We are a pioneer that enabled — and helped scale — investor access to the fastest-growing asset class in recent history,"" Chairman Barry Silbert wrote in the filing. ""Our platform offers investors diversified exposure to the digital asset class that is management fee-based, capital efficient and cash flow generating.""
The filing comes amid a broader wave of crypto-native firms seeking U.S. public listings, following the IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group (CRCL) and crypto exchange Bullish (BLSH), the owner of CoinDesk, earlier this year.
The company reported net income of $203 million for the nine months to Sept. 30 in the filing, a 9.1% drop compared to the equivalent period in 2024.  Revenue also fell 20% from $398 million to $318.7 million, while the average value of the company's assets under management (AUM) shed 3.5% to $30.6 billion. 
The company's AUM as of the end of September was around $35 billion, according to the filing.

                            Sold off in the 1990s, the UK’s railways are returning to public hands — but at what cost?
                        

Gareth Dennis, 

Liberalization of the railways has been a key tenet of European transport policy since the early 2000s, with proponents claiming that competition results in improved service quality and increased ridership. This is an instantly disprovable statement given that ridership was already on the rise across Europe prior to, rather than after, liberalization efforts, suggesting other effects are at play.
Gareth Dennis is an award-winning railway engineer and writer. He is the author of the internationally bestselling book How The Railways Will Fix the Future and co-founder of the Campaign for Level Boarding.
On the other hand, the case against fragmented and privatized operations focuses on three key arguments. The first is that railways are complex systems where commercial boundaries at engineering interfaces are a threat to safety and efficiency. The second is that railway operations are geographic monopolies where market conditions are — at best — contrived. The third is that railways are a public service that cannot fail — hence, introducing private interests into the railways is merely a way to sequester income into private hands while the state shoulders the financial risk. In other words, private interests’ role is simply to extract profit that could otherwise be reinvested into the system.
The United Kingdom was one of first countries in Europe to liberalize a significant portion of its railways (Northern Ireland’s railways remained publicly owned and operated). As such, the aftermath of privatization is instructive in tracing liberalization’s final destination. In short: it isn’t pretty.
The UK’s contiguous network in Wales, Scotland, and England was privatized in stages between 1988 and 1997, starting with its domestic train manufacturing industry. This took place following a massive self-off of public assets in the aftermath of the broader financialization of the British economy. For example, the water industry in England and Wales was wholly divested through the 1980s — something no other country has ever done. Thanks to archived papers from then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, we can understand precisely what the political drivers for mass privatization were.
First, as a large employer of over 50,000 staff, divesting the water industry would greatly contribute to “the privatisation programme”. Second, it would take necessary investment in an ageing asset off the public books. Finally, it would increase shareholding in the public, mitigate state interference, and create financial assets for trade. It is worth noting that none of these justifications took the quality or expansion of services into account.
And so, we turn back to railways. In 1990, things had been looking up for British Rail. Ridership had been climbing solidly since the mid-1980s. The average subsidy was as low as 20 percent of running costs, making the British system one of the most efficient in Europe. Urban, regional, and high-speed rail projects were being delivered or, in the latter case, were in serious development.
Three rolling stock operating companies bought — at rock-bottom prices — an enormous range of hugely valuable trains for which British Rail had scrimped and saved over the preceding decades.
Then the early-1990s recession hit. More than a decade of constrained public spending and service sell-offs meant there was an immediate impact on passenger numbers, sending the government into a panic. Suddenly, the Thatcherite doctrine of “sell everything but the railways” was thrown out the window, and plans for privatization were put in motion.
In July 1992, a white paper entitled “New Opportunities for the Railways” was published, heavily informed by Treasury mandarins and their advisers at the Tufton Street-based Adam Smith Institute in London. It recommended nothing less than an atomization of the formerly integrated railway operating structure, with the creation of as many independent elements as possible to maximize perceived opportunities for competition.
On 1 April 1994, the Railways Act came into effect and the demise of British Rail began. It is worth noting that privatization had already started in the 1980s, for example with the sale of the train manufacturers in Derby and various ferry operations. But the 1990s was different — this was a fire sale.
The first private entity to be created was Railtrack, which took over the railway infrastructure such as track, signals, and stations. Seven infrastructure maintenance units and six track renewal units were set up to split off maintenance from operation. Six freight operating companies were created. Twenty-five train operating units were also established, which from 1996 onwards were franchised out to the train operating companies.
Three rolling stock operating companies (ROSCOs) bought — at rock-bottom prices — an enormous range of hugely valuable trains for which British Rail had scrimped and saved over the preceding decades. They then leased these back to the train operators at eye-watering cost and with little oversight, enabling a significant outflow of cash from the industry. This has incentivized one of British passengers’ biggest gripes — the widespread use of trains that are as short as possible to minimize leasing costs, without a care for the resulting overcrowding.
Another impact of the ROSCOs landing a large, cheap asset that they could rent out at high prices was the near-death of the UK train manufacturing industry, as there was no incentive to continue British Rail's programme of fleet renewals. In the aftermath of privatization, only British Rail’s partially fulfilled orders remained on the books, and new passenger trains wouldn't be built at volume until the early 2000s, resulting in the demise of all but the Derby works. At great cost, new plants have opened in Newton Aycliffe and Newport since, but even these are once again under threat thanks to the lack of any long-term rolling stock strategy.
All franchises had been awarded, a plethora of regulating and organizing bodies had been established to hold the system together, and privatization was essentially complete by 1 April 1997, achieving the outgoing administration’s goal of completing the process by the next general election. Despite promises to the contrary, New Labour’s coming into power did not result in a reversal of the process.
Franchise agreements, now managed by the Department for Transport, were growing more complex and more restrictive.
However, in September 1997, an express train collided with a freight train in Southall, London, killing seven people and injuring 139 others. A lack of effective communication between the fragmented elements of the railway was the root cause of the horrific crash, the first of a series of serious fatal derailments that were attributable to the new structure of the railways.
In October 1999, the death of 31 people and the injury of 417 others at Ladbroke Grove, London, resulted in a cascade of changes to safety regulation. The derailment of an express train at Hatfield in October 2000 killed four people and injured 70, sending shockwaves through the industry as it had resulted directly from Railtrack’s self-perception as a contract management organization, not an engineering outfit. This fomented the demise of Railtrack, which was absorbed into a new government body called Network Rail. A gargantuan and rushed effort to replace thousands of miles of substandard track materials followed, requiring billions of pounds of additional funds and greatly impacting passenger numbers for several years.
Another fatal derailment at Potters Bar in May 2002 killed seven people and was caused by the negligence of a private maintenance company. This led to the return of many maintenance tasks in-house under Network Rail. With the process of Railtrack’s reconstitution as Network Rail completing in October 2002, the UK’s rail infrastructure had been de facto renationalized.
The West Coast Main Line had long been considered the jewel in the crown of the British rail network, having been electrified and modernized through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. By 1998, passenger growth was putting significant pressure on the route, and Virgin’s Richard Branson wanted to introduce new tilting trains and a much more frequent timetable. By 2002, costs had risen from 2.5 billion to 14.5 billion pounds (just short of 30 billion pounds in today’s money), and the scope of the project had been severely curtailed. What started in 1998 as a promise for a 140-miles-per-hour railway with fully digital signalling had descended into chaos by the early 2000s, contributing to Railtrack’s demise.
By this point, railways were at their most popular since the beginning of the previous century. Passenger numbers were skyrocketing, and a cross-party consensus agreed that rail investment and the expansion of the rail network were a good thing. Franchises previously let as “not for growth” such as those in Wales and the North were creaking at the seams as people turned to trains.
Franchise agreements, now managed by the Department for Transport, were growing more complex and more restrictive. The number of bidders reduced, and the ambition of their bids increased. This came to a head in 2009, when National Express was stripped of the East Coast franchise after failing to meet its payment targets despite continuing passenger growth.
In 2012, the West Coast bidding process was scrapped by government and was awarded as a short-term concession pending a review, and amidst a wider crisis across the industry in June 2018, the East Coast franchise — subsequently awarded to yet another optimistic bid by Virgin — also collapsed and had to be returned to state operation. By this point, franchise bidders were few and far between, and the system was close to collapse.
Railways must be set into the bigger transport picture with ambitious targets — mobility in totality, not rail in isolation.
These increasingly overambitious bids, combined with ever-more complex and controlling contracts, left only one lever open to the train operators to cut costs: staffing. From 2016 onwards, a wave of increasingly disruptive strikes took hold of the network, as terms and conditions were altered to attempt to reduce the number of staff the train operating companies had to have on their books.
Just as the industry’s new structure had resulted in the creation of the ROSCOs, which incentivised a freeze in new train procurement, the creation of Railtrack and its private suppliers resulted in a freeze in recruitment across the infrastructure domain. Crudely, when you have a fleet of trains that already run the service, why build new ones? The same ended up being broadly true for infrastructure — why employ new staff when you already have an enormous workforce?
A decade-wide gap in skills was the consequence. With the growth in passenger demand came a huge growth in the number of infrastructure projects being carried out, and this skills bottleneck, combined with an industry structure that exacerbated costs by maximizing the number of organizational interfaces, meant work was being delivered too slowly and at too high a price. Cost escalations became unbearable for government in 2017 and resulted not only in the curtailment of the national electrification programme, but also in the abandonment of other enhancements across the country, particularly in and around the north of England. Meanwhile, there was a glut of new train orders, many for new electric trains for which there were no longer overhead wires planned to power them.
May 2018 was supposed to be the moment that an enormous leap in capacity was created. New track and trains would enable a great leap in the number of trains running in the timetable. As it happened, neither the track nor the trains were in place to deliver much of this uplift, and the result was a collapse in the system’s reliability. Driver training could not happen, and a lack of trains, tracks, and staff resulted in the cancellation of upwards of one third of services in the South East and the north of England, with lesser but significant effects felt by passengers across the network.
Long an opponent of the franchise system and the lack of integration between track and train, then Secretary of State for Transport Chris Grayling initiated the Williams Review in 2018 to work out what shape the industry needed to be in to enable growth without cycling back to calamity. This review took time to pick up speed, leaving the industry in perpetual crisis mode.
In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reduced ridership to 5 percent of pre-COVID levels and the industry was placed on life support. By the end of that month, all franchises were transferred onto emergency concessions, and the franchise system was gone. This was made official in September 2020, as the government stated that franchising was to cease to exist, and by April 2021 the National Audit Office announced that train operators were to be officially classified as state-owned, despite the continued involvement of private companies. The irony of a Conservative than a Labour government beginning the re-integration of the system should not be lost on readers — indeed, this is a recurring theme.
Finally, in May 2021, the Williams—Shapps Plan for Rail was published, setting out a loose view of the future structure of the railways. Although lacking in details, the headline was that a new organization called Great British Railways (GBR) was to be created. A transition team was established to understand what GBR would do and how it would be structured. The ROSCOs, as the last major vestige of the Railways Act 1993, remained untouched.
Roll forwards seven years and, despite several train operators being controlled directly by the Department for Transport, there is still no clear picture of what GBR will be empowered or funded to do, let alone what its structure and intentions will be. Meanwhile, a general election has worsened, not improved, the outlook for the railway industry, as the number of major projects continues to fall alongside ongoing maintenance funding. Capacity is more squeezed than ever before.
The rail industry needs democratization, so that decisions about the railways we use are made closer to us. 
Despite the public’s continued support for publicly owned railways — 75% in 2025 compared with 60% in 2017 — the extent to which “nationalization” will achieve democratic oversight and the necessary reinvigoration of the industry remains unclear. Britain’s rail unions are cautiously supportive, but it is worth noting that scepticism has grown as the Labour Party drifts further to the centre.
The rail industry needs democratization, so that decisions about the railways we use are made closer to us. That means moving power, including over spending, away from Westminster. Democratic accountability at local and regional levels is key to unlocking the cycle of proposed and cancelled investment, and in pushing operators to do better. That means devolution of decision and funding powers to both the regions and cities, but also delivering sufficient industry funding autonomy so that it can respond quickly to these demands and rise above electoral cycles and fiscal anxiety.
Railways must be set into the bigger transport picture with ambitious targets — mobility in totality, not rail in isolation. Moreover, investment must be matched to those targets to build a railway that more people can use and benefit from — more capacity, more reliability and more accessibility.
Empowerment of the rail industry as a self-governing entity accountable chiefly to the UK’s regions and cities rather than to central government is a critical step in kicking things out of crisis mode and reshaping the industry to be fit for the long-term future. But as important is the need for the railways to tell a story about themselves that the public can get behind. Only with an ambitious and exciting vision of the future will the railways fulfil their true potential. Privatization, as the British experience shows, utterly failed to do so.

Some unionized Starbucks baristas are tired of waiting for a contract.
It's Red Cup Day when Starbucks, which is in the middle of a massive turnaround campaign, gives away reusable cups and usually rakes in record sales. Today, more than 1,000 baristas plan to walk off the job, in hopes that the coffee giant sits down to finalize their first contract.
The Starbucks Workers Union said baristas at more than 65 stores across 40 US cities are launching a strike on Thursday, which could disrupt a historically major sales promotion. In 2024, Red Cup Day at Starbucks drove a 42.4% spike in daily visits relative to an average Thursday, according to foot traffic data from Placer.ai.
Workers at more than 550 union stores are prepared to join the strike if negotiations don't resume, the union said in a statement. The work stoppage marks the fourth strike the union has organized since 2023, and the third work stoppage since CEO Brian Niccol took the helm of the company in September 2024.
A Starbucks spokesperson told Business Insider on Thursday morning that 99.9% of Starbucks' stores are open, and that if the union actions cause temporary closures, stores nearby can serve customers. She said the company is on track to exceed its sales expectations for the day across company-operated coffeehouses in North America.
""We're disappointed that Workers United, [which] represents less than 4% of our partners, has called for a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table,"" the Starbucks spokesperson said.
The company has 16,864 stores across the US, its most recent financial report said.
The workers have been trying to ratify their collective bargaining agreement since the first store unionized in December 2021. After some progress and a commitment by the company to reach a labor agreement by the end of 2024, contract talks collapsed last December.
Starbucks corporate and the unionized workers have blamed each other for the breakdown.
""We've been very clear — when the union is ready to come back to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,"" Starbucks' spokesperson said on Thursday.
Starbucks Workers United said in a statement it's ready to bargain and is waiting on Starbucks to return to the table with new economic proposals and solutions to more than 700 unresolved unfair labor practice charges related to allegations of retaliation and union-busting.
The latest strike comes after the company initiated a $1 billion restructuring as part of its ""Back to Starbucks"" revitalization effort. The September restructuring involved the closure of more than 600 stores, resulting in the layoff of thousands of baristas and the elimination of over 900 non-retail jobs.
Starbucks is also investing an additional $500 million into what it calls its Green Apron Service effort to improve the coffeehouse experience, the spokesperson said. That includes investments in staffing, training, and support.
The union said there has been an increased interest in stores joining its ranks since the restructuring. However, since the beginning of President Donald Trump's term in January, the National Labor Relations Board, which certifies union elections, has not had the minimum number of members needed to issue decisions or take formal actions.
As a result, votes to unionize additional stores are in limbo, and their baristas are without the full protection of the National Labor Relations Act, which dictates the rights of unionized workers.
That means Starbucks baristas who were not recognized as part of the union prior to January cannot join the strike, Cathy Creighton, a former field attorney for the National Labor Relations Board, told Business Insider.
With a low density of unionized stores compared to Starbucks' massive footprint, and without the ability to recruit new members for now, the public fight is likely to become more contentious as baristas try to ramp up the pressure, Creighton, who is now director of Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab, said.
""Starbucks workers are much more resilient than I ever would have thought — they're much more resilient than most workers have been in the past, continuing to fight all these years,"" Creighton said. ""And they have to do something, or they'll lose the momentum and the membership that they have gained. This is also a signal to other workers: 'Hey, we're we're out here fighting, come join us.'""
Dachi Spoltore, a barista of five years from the Amos Hall location in Pittsburgh, who walked out on strike, said in a statement that the union is ""turning the Red Cup Season into the Red Cup Rebellion.""
""Starbucks' refusal to settle a fair union contract and end union busting is forcing us to take drastic action,"" Spoltore said. ""For every one barista on strike, dozens more allies and customers have pledged to honor the picket line and not buy Starbucks while we're on strike.""
Business Insider previously reported that some shareholders are increasingly concerned about labor tensions as the company navigates its turnaround campaign. Some lawmakers have expressed support for in-store staff.
On November 10, over 100 US senators and representatives, led by Sen. Bernie Sanders and the House Labor Caucus, sent letters to Niccol that cited his nearly $100 million pay package, and ""extravagant spending on executives and shareholders"" as evidence that ""Starbucks has the money to reach a fair agreement with its workers.""
""Starbucks must reverse course from its current posture, resolve its existing labor disputes, and bargain a fair contract in good faith with these employees,"" the lawmakers wrote.
A group of shareholders also published an open letter to the company's board in October, urging Starbucks to resume contract talks before the labor dispute affects its share price.
Starbucks' stock has declined by more than 5% this year. The company's most recent fiscal report, released in late October, showed that its fourth-quarter comparable sales rose 1% globally, driven by new protein-focused drinks. It was the first time in seven quarters that Starbucks had reported a comparable sales increase.
The shareholder letter cited concern for the company's reputation and potential impact on investors. It was signed by Trillium Asset Management, Shareholder Association for Research and Education (SHARE), Pensions Investment Research Consultants (PIRC) on behalf of investor clients, and New York City Comptroller Brad Lander.
The October letter is not the first time shareholders have expressed concern over Starbucks' labor relations. In 2023, Trillium, the New York Comptroller's Office, and SHARE were among the proponents of a proposal for the company to conduct an independent, third-party assessment of its labor practices.
""Starbucks' failure to reach a contract agreement with the union illustrates mounting operational disruptions and risk exposure for the company and its shareholders,"" Juana Lee, the associate director of corporate engagement at SHARE, told Business Insider on the eve of the strike. ""Now is the time for Starbucks to engage in collective bargaining that leads to a fair agreement in a timely manner.""
Update: November 13, 2025 — This story has been updated with additional information from a Starbucks spokesperson.

Two NYPD officers sustained minor injuries during a scuffle involving federal immigration agents in Washington Heights Wednesday morning, police said.
The incident happened as federal agents made multiple arrests in the neighborhood and residents called 911 to report four armed men pulling people out of cars, according to the NYPD and local officials.
NYPD officers began driving around the neighborhood searching when they spotted a group of people chasing somebody near 164th St. and Broadway. The officers jumped out of their cars to intervene before realizing the people chasing were federal immigration agents, according to the NYPD.
Officials said the federal agents verbally identified themselves as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents after the interaction but wore sweatshirts without any visual markings of their agency. The NYPD is forbidden from assisting in civil immigration enforcement.
Authorities said the officers were treated for minor injuries and that it happened during the interaction with ICE.
City Councilmember Shaun Abreu, who represents the area, posted a video to social media of what he said was a separate immigration enforcement action that happened around the same time. That video, recorded at 157th and Broadway, showed agents pulling a man from a car.
Peter Green, the man who recorded the video, told Gothamist in an interview that NYPD officers arrived at least a minute or two after the federal agents had left with the person taken from the car.
Abreu called the the incident at 157th and Broadway, “deeply disturbing.”
“I condemn this despicable pattern of intimidation,” he said. “ICE and other federal agencies that are carrying out Trump’s agenda of detaining people without due process have no place in our city.”
Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said ICE arrested an ""illegal alien from Guinea"" and chided Abreu.
""Council Member Shaun Abreu should stop fearmongering and smearing our brave law enforcement who are facing 1000% increase in assaults against them and an nearly 8000% increase in death threats,"" she said in a written statement.
She did not address the interaction with NYPD officers.
This story has been updated with a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and to clarify details about the interaction between the officers and agents.

69,2025-11-13,"The leaker who first revealed the name of the iPhone 16e is now saying that demand for the device has been very low. However, they say that despite this setback, Apple is for now still planning to proceed with plans for the iPhone 17e.
They also say that production of the iPhone Air has now ceased completely, following an earlier report that output levels had been slashed …
The iPhone 16E replaced the iPhone SE as Apple’s entry-level model, intended to attract Android users who were unwilling to pay the premium prices of flagship iPhone models.
While the iPhone SE had been updated at random intervals, the iPhone 16E name seemed to strongly hint at annual revisions. It was leaker Fixed Focus Digital who first reported the name before the phone was officially announced, and who subsequently spotted evidence of plans for annual updates.
Reports have suggested that next year’s version will be a relatively modest refresh set to launch in the spring.
The same source now says that the iPhone 16e is not selling well, but plans for the 17e will go ahead.
iPhone Air and iPhone 16E are not selling well [but] at present, both models will be updated as planned, the 17E in the spring.
iPhone Air flop is because of the premium price.
Why would people pay a Pro price for a less-capable-than-regular device?

Drop the price, keep one camera.
It was last month reported that iPhone Air orders had been slashed to almost end-of-production levels. Fixed Focus Digital says that production of the device has now ceased altogether.
Work on it has been stopped.
It’s unclear whether the cessation is permanent, with no more of the models to be made, or just a hiatus as Apple waits to clear a backlog of stock. 
A major reason for limited interest in the super-sleek model appears to have been the compromise of just a single camera. It was recently reported that Apple is now exploring a second-generation model with two cameras instead of one and has delayed the planned launch for this reason.

73,2025-11-13,"Another difficult day in markets has bitcoin BTC$99,534.67 lower by nearly 3% to $98,600, helping to drag down the largest corporate holder of BTC, Strategy (MSTR), by 6.6%.
Now trading at $210, MSTR has returned to levels not seen since the weeks prior to the election of Donald Trump last November. Shares are lower by 30% year-to-date and 36% year-over-year, though remaining massively higher since Michael Saylor and team adopted a bitcoin treasury strategy in August 2020.
The plunge in Strategy relative to the price of bitcoin prompted some on social media to declare the stock in buy territory due to its market cap now being sizably below the value of its BTC stack, i.e. a so-called mNAV below 1.
Indeed, Strategy's 641,692 bitcoin are worth $63.2 billion, or about 5% more than the current market cap of $60 billion. This calculation, however, leaves out all of the company's preferred and debt issuance — both of which have higher payback preference than the common stock.
Adding those items brings Strategy's enterprise value to $75.4 billion, or nearly 20% more than the value of its bitcoin holdings — numbers made clear on Strategy's own dashboard, which showed an mNAV of 1.19 at press time.
Strategy common stock may turn out to be cheap or maybe expensive, but it is not — at current levels — changing hands at a discount to the company's bitcoin.

CEO Allan Marshall emphasized that the company would execute the plan opportunistically and without affecting its ability to invest in growth or maintain a strong treasury.
The move aligns Upexi with a growing number of digital asset treasury firms turning to share repurchases as their stock prices tumbled over the past months amid waning investor appetite. With market capitalizations in some cases now well beneath the value of the crypto on their balance sheet, DATs reason that buybacks can prove accretive.
Upexi's decision comes as the firm's stock fell over 50% since early October, and almost 90% from the April high. Shares are down 4.4% on Thursday alongside a continuing slide in crypto prices. SOL is barely hanging above $150 now lower by almost 30% over the past month and 20% year-to-date.
The company currently holds 2.1 million SOL, valued at roughly $319 million.

75,2025-11-13,"Jessi and Jordan Ngatikaura are selling their Salt Lake City home after speculation that the pair were getting a divorce ... TMZ has learned.
""The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives"" stars' 6-bedroom, 5-bath property hit the market Thursday with a $2.499 million price tag. The luxury pad, which is heavily featured on the hit Hulu series, sits minutes from Sundance Ski Resort.
Clocking in at nearly 7,000 square feet on more than half an acre, the estate is packed with amenities. Inside, buyers will find a full fitness center, guest suite, wet bar and a legit movie theater. Outside, it's a resort vibe all around ... pool, pickleball court, gas firepit, and a putting green.
The listing dropped the same day season 3 premiered and fans have noticed Jessi has switched her last name on Instagram and TikTok from ""Ngatikaura"" back to ""Draper.""
Viewers will recall season 2 ended with a bombshell confession from ""Vanderpump Villa"" star Marciano Brunette, who claimed he and Jessi hooked up while she was still married. Jessi and Jordan haven't publicly addressed the fallout though they told fans at the season 2 reunion the truth would unfold in season 3.
The home is listed by Bravo's ""Sold on SLC"" star Kenny Sperry of Presidio Real Estate. The trio came up in reality TV together and stayed close, and with Kenny now mentoring Jessi's costar Dakota Mortensen, he was the obvious choice to list the property.
Whether the sale signals a plot twist or just a real estate play, fans are already bracing for the drama to unfold. Stay tuned!

EXCLUSIVE: OneGate Media will bring crime thriller Blind to the international market after scooping the rights to the upcoming TV drama, which is based on Christine Brand’s bestselling Milla Nova series of novels.

	Swiss author Brand’s book series has sold over 400,000 copies so the upcoming TV drama adaptation is much anticipated – so much so that Swiss broadcaster SRF is developing a second season of the TV adaptation ahead of the launch of the first season next year. The plan is for a returning drama with each season based on one of Brand’s books.

	Blind is made by Zodiac Pictures, producer of the series New Heights (aka Neumatt), which is on Netflix, and Late Shift, the Swiss entry for the Best International Feature Film Oscar.

	Per the synopsis, Blind follows a visually impaired bartender who claims a pregnant woman was kidnapped from his bar. Investigators find signs of a struggle but no trace of the victim, and Inspector Bandini identifies Nathaniel as the prime suspect. Determined to prove his innocence, Nathaniel finds an ally in investigative journalist Milla. Together, they uncover a web of lies, secrets and hidden connections.

	Plinio Bachmann created the series, which is co-directed by Christian Johannes Koch and Barbara Kulcsar.

	“Blind elevates the crime genre to a new level,” said Tania Reichert-Facilides, Managing Director of OneGate Media, which is a subsidiary of German pubcaster ARD. “It represents the growing international appetite for sophisticated European storytelling, as well as the high-quality production value that we prioritise on our slate.”

	“This series, like Brand’s novels, is truly ‘made in Switzerland’-  and packed with twists and turns, intriguing characters and psychological depth,” added Jessica Hefti at Zodiac Pictures. “At the heart of this series is the character of Nathaniel and his visual impairment, adding a unique and powerful element to the story.”

vivo Android

vivo unveiled the X300 and X300 Pro last month in China, and later introduced them in European markets. Now, the brand has announced that both smartphones are ""coming soon"" to India.
vivo hasn't revealed the India launch date of the X300 and X300 Pro, but rumors claim the two phones will debut in the world's second-largest smartphone market in the first week of December.
The promo page set up by vivo on its official Indian website shows the X300 Pro in brown and the X300 in red. However, there may be more color options for the Indian market that are yet to be confirmed.
What once was beyond reach is now all yours to capture. The #vivoX300Series. Coming soon. #vivoIndia #GoIntoTheWild pic.twitter.com/5Cq8PmtH1R
vivo will also launch the Photographer Kit in India, which will include the 2.35x Telephoto Extender. It's compatible with both the X300 and X300 Pro and will be sold separately.
You can check the detailed specs comparison of the vivo X300 and X300 Pro here. After that, you can read our vivo X300 Pro review here and X300 review here.
That's such a weird thing to say ""buy a camera"" yeah let's open GSM arena and post a comment on it? Tf just be fr that's a PHONE with an additional lense not a full frame camera 
I just hope, truly hope. They get the yellow/cream/whitish color of the Pro for the smaller x300 here too. That pink is just too 'sweet' for my liking. 
Can we get the x300 ultra please? Esp given the news of a separate global model.

DJI Drones

The DJI Neo 2 is now available in most markets around the world after launching in China at the end of October. A notable exception is the US – all new DJI products skip the US due to the current political and market conditions.
Here are the prices for everyone else – note that the price in Canada is given in USD rather than CAD. We’re not sure whether this is a typo or a wink and a nod at how US customers can acquire the Neo 2 (but you probably shouldn’t since there will be no after-market support in the US).
Note that the prices above are only for the drone. The DJI Neo 2 is meant for beginners or people who want to capture drone footage without any fuss – you can control it with gestures and/or a smartphone app.
However, it fully supports more advanced control methods – you can get the Fly More combo for $400/£350/€400, which includes the RC-N3 remote, two extra batteries and a charging hub for three batteries. There’s also the Motion Fly More Combo at $550/£510/€580, which features the DJI Goggles N3 and RC Motion 3 controller for FPV flights.




The DJI Neo 2 has multiple control options, ranging from gestures to FPV
In case you missed the original launch, here is an overview of the DJI Neo 2. It’s a lightweight drone at 151g (160g with the DJI Neo 2 Digital Transceiver), slightly more than the 135g of the original Neo but well below the 250g limit.
It flies faster – up to 5m/s in sports mode compared to just 2m/s for the old one – and a bit longer (up to 19 minutes vs. up to 18 minutes). It is more resilient to wind too with a Level 5 rating (up to 10.7m/s) compared to Level 4 (8m/s). And you get double the internal storage at 49GB.
The far more advanced sensor suite combines an omnidirectional vision system with forward-facing LiDAR, while the original Neo only had a downward-facing positioning system. This also enables ActiveTrack (with the new Cycling option).
The Neo 2 uses the same 1/2” sensor as its predecessor but brings a wider f/2.2 lens (vs. f/2.6). Even better, the single-axis gimbal was replaced by a more capable 2-axis mechanism (tilt and roll).
Video recording was upgraded to 4K 60fps (up from 4K 30fps) in horizontal mode and 2.7K 60fps (up from 1080p 60fps) in vertical mode. By default, the drone uses a Wi-Fi video transmission system, but you can equip it with DJI’s O4 system, which adds a few extra grams of weight. The Wi-Fi system has a range up to 500m, the O4 system can go out to 10km. Note that the transceiver is sold separately but comes included with the Fly More combos.

82,2025-11-13,"Apple is widely expected to launch its first foldable iPhone next year. Routinely referred to as the iPhone Fold, the handset will be similar to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold models, though it might feature a different aspect ratio. A new report from Korean site The Bell says that Samsung sees the iPhone Fold as a threat to its entire foldable smartphone business, not just the Galaxy Z Fold family. As a result, Samsung wants its 2026 foldable phones to be more competitive, so the imminent iPhone Fold can't hurt its dominant market share. According to the report, Samsung plans to sell 10% more Galaxy Z Fold 8 and Galaxy Z Flip 8 units combined than their predecessors. To do that, the company is focusing on the Galaxy Z Flip model, aiming to give the clamshell phone a big redesign.
The report notes that Samsung's desire to push Galaxy Z Flip 8 sales is a direct response to Apple releasing its first foldable phone next year. The Bell says that Apple's plans to release a foldable iPhone became known to top Samsung management in early 2024 via reports from U.S. media, causing concern. A top executive reportedly demanded that Samsung's mobile division increase the competitiveness of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 models. Apple's entry into the foldable space could expand the market, but it could also threaten Samsung's position in ways Chinese vendors couldn't.
Samsung launched its first foldable phone in 2019, a Fold-type model. Since then, Chinese smartphone vendors have come out with several innovations in the space that Samsung was late to adopt. Honor made ultra-thin Fold-type foldables for years before Samsung matched the size. Oppo introduced a larger cover screen on a clamshell phone before the Galaxy Z Flip got one.
Samsung gave the Galaxy Z Fold 7 a major redesign this year, making it thinner and lighter than previous models. The handset is 4.2 mm thick when unfolded and 8.9 mm thick when folded. Compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, the thickness decreased by 26.4% and 25%, respectively. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 weighs 215g, 10% lighter than its predecessor. But the Galaxy Z Flip 7 did not see a similar design upgrade. The phone has the same weight as its predecessor (188g) and the thickness reduction was marginal. At 13.7 mm (folded) and 6.5 mm (unfolded), the phone is 8.1% and 5.8% thinner than the Galaxy Z Flip 6.
Samsung wants to reduce both the Galaxy Z Flip 8's weight and thickness by at least 10%. If that were to happen, the phone would weigh 169g and measure 12.3 mm (folded) and 5.9 mm (unfolded). The report also notes that Samsung might go for even more drastic reductions in weight and size, so consumers feel a more dramatic change, similar to the reaction to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 this year. It's unclear how these changes will impact the Galaxy Z Flip 8's battery size, but the Galaxy Z Flip's makeover is necessary for Samsung to reach its sales goals.
The report also notes that Samsung wants to sell 6.7 million Galaxy Z Fold 8 and Galaxy Z Flip 8 units combined next year despite the iPhone Fold's arrival. Samsung should launch the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and Galaxy Z Flip 8 in July or August next year, several weeks before Apple's iPhone event in September, where the iPhone Fold should be introduced."

Well, this is a strange one. Just minutes before it was set to deliver its financial results for the first half of its 2025-26 fiscal year, Ubisoft mashed the brakes on the whole thing, postponing the release of its results to an unspecified future date. The company also requested that European exchange Euronext halt trading of the company's shares and bonds from November 14 until the publication of its results.
No reason for the postponement or trading halt was provided, but these things are rarely the result of good news. They often arise from events like unexpected major news announcements or regulatory problems that can have the potential to trigger panic selling.
 



There's no sign that's the case here, but Ubisoft is in a unique and precarious situation right now. The company's share price is in the toilet, and it recently entered into a deal with Tencent to establish a new ""creative house"" called Vantage Studios that will assume control of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six properties. Leading up to that, though, was something of a low-key power struggle: Tencent wanted to assert more control over Ubisoft, but the founding Guillemot family was reluctant to let go of the wheel.
The deal reached in March left the existing Ubisoft power structure in place—Charlie Guillemot, son of Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, is co-chief of the new venture, make of that what you will—but as we noted when Vantage Studios was formally christened, it's a name and not much more at this point, and there's still plenty of room for things to go wrong.
It seems clear that, at the very least, things aren't going exactly right, but beyond that it's pure speculation. Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad, who specializes in the videogame markets in Asia and MENA, said on Bluesky that the postponement ""could indicate a major announcement related to the company.""
 



Ahmad added that the results pause ""could imply an acquisition of sorts""—someone making a surprise move on the Ubisoft rubble, possibly—but it could just as easily be an ""accounting/financial issue."" Either way, he recommended that everyone ""freak the fuck out for the next few days and speculate as much as possible until they announce something,"" which I suspect may not be entirely serious advice.
I've reached out to Ubisoft for comment on the results delay—given the strict market regulations that are no doubt intertwined in all of this, I don't imagine I'll hear anything back, but I'll update if I do.

85,2025-11-13,"Spotify is, undoubtedly, one of the biggest music streaming platforms out there. However, gone are the days when it could just sit around and enjoy market share.
The arrival and proliferation of rivals like YouTube Music, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and more has forced platforms to innovate and address complaints, and that's a major win for users. 
Two of the major complaints users have long had with Spotify are the lack of music videos and an overall unreliable shuffle feature — two major complaints that Spotify is addressing now!
Following a beta launch in the UK, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Brazil, Colombia, Philippines, Indonesia, and Kenya in 2024, the music streaming giant is finally bringing music videos to the US and Canada (via Variety).
Music videos are expected to roll out in the ""coming weeks,"" allowing users to switch between audio and video, similar to YouTube Music's implementation. Overseas, the feature is limited to Premium users. The same is likely to be the case in the US and Canada. 
This comes soon after Spotify and the National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) announced a license agreement, which was expected to give Spotify ""new rights to build video features that better connect artists and fans."" 
Alongside Spotify's push for more visual content, the music streaming giant is finally making significant changes to how its shuffle feature works. Although most would already know, for those unaware, shuffle essentially forces the app to play songs in a random order, be it from an album or a playlist. 
The feature, up until now, has been very inconsistent. Platforms like Reddit are full of user complaints about Shuffle, with most suggesting that the feature often repeats a select few songs, even when the playlist in question has hundreds of tracks. 
Finally realizing that this is a pain point for users, the music streaming giant is finally updating shuffle to ensure ""Fewer Repeats."" 
This version takes your recent listening into account, so songs you heard recently are less likely to repeat soon, helping your playlists stay fresh and surprising.
'Fewer Repeats' is the new default mode. Spotify Premium users who'd like to revert to the OG shuffle behavior can do so by switching to Standard Shuffle by heading to Settings > Playback > Standard.

Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospectiv released late las month. and was made by the team behind the popular Legend of Zelda guidebooks.

 Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective 
 $39.66 (was $50) | Available Now 
 
Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective is on sale for over 20% off at Amazon. Normally $50, the beautiful hardcover book is up for grabs for $39.66 (was $50). This is the first substantial discount since the official art book hit stores October 28. Amazon doesn't list an end date for the deal, so Metroid fans should snag a copy while they can. Flipping through the 210-page, fully illustrated retrospective is a great way to pass the time until Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches December 4.
As a longtime Metroid fan myself, I thoroughly enjoyed my time reading the behind-the-scenes details and insights from the team behind the Metroid Prime Trilogy. Not only is it an entertaining read, but it's a truly gorgeous book that would look great displayed on any bookcase or display shelf.
The hardcover book is wrapped in cloth that gives it a premium look and feel. The illustration of Samus in her Varia Suit is etched to the front cover in metallic gold, which makes it shimmer when rotating the book toward light--sort of like a lenticular piece of art. The back cover has a small Metroid Prime logo etched in the center.
The retrospective is printed on high-quality, sheet-fed art paper, and the pages are stitched to the binding to increase durability.
Each page is filled with full-color concept art and sketches, many of which are accompanied by background descriptions or producer's notes by the teamat Retro Studios who developed each game.
Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective covers the development of the original Metroid Prime (2002) for GameCube, Prime 2: Echoes (2004), Prime 3: Corruption (2007), and Metroid Prime Remastered (2023).
The foreword was written by Metroid Prime series producer Kensuke Tanabe, and each of the four sections are introduced by a developer from Retro Studios.
Metroid Prime Trilogy's retrospective was designed by Piggyback in collaboration with Retro Studios and Nintendo. Piggyback is best known for its wonderful The Legend of Zelda strategy guides for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.
 
The retrospective is one of several recently released collectibles themed around the Metroid Prime Trilogy and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Last week, Nintendo released two of the three Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo figures. The new Samus Aran Amiibo is available for $30, while the larger Samus & Vi-O-La Amiibo--the bounty hunter's new motorbike--is up for grabs for $40.
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Nintendo Amiibo:
While you're checking out the Amiibo at Amazon, make sure to look at the brand-new Club Mocchi-Mocchi Mega Plush. These are the first officially licensed plushies for Metroid Prime by TOMY, and both are in stock as of November 13.
 
 Club Mocchi-Mocchi Metroid Prime Samus Helmet 13.5"" Mega Plush 
 $39 
 Club Mocchi-Mocchi Metroid Prime Morph Ball 12"" Mega Plush 
 $39 
 
Three new budget-friendly Metroid Prime action figure packs by Jakks Pacific are available now at Walmart. You can get three 2.5-inch Samus figures dressed in different armor for $15. Samus in her Varia Suit alongside two Metroids is also priced at $15. Lastly, there's a 6-inch Metroid figure for $25 that glows from ultraviolet light. All three new releases are officially licensed by Nintendo.
 Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for Nintendo Switch 2 
 $70 | Releases December 4 
 Metroid Prime 4: Beyond for Nintendo Switch 
 $60 | Releases December 4 
Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches December 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch. The Switch 2 version is available to preorder at Amazon, Walmart, and other major retailers for $70. The original Switch version is up for preorder for $60. If you want to upgrade to Switch 2 to play Metroid Prime 4 in 4K resolution, Amazon has both Nintendo Switch 2 console bundles in stock. The recently launched Pokemon Legends: Z-A Bundle and Mario Kart World Bundle are available for $499 each.
 
If you want to play the new Metroid game with a controller themed around the franchise, PowerA recently launched an officially licensed wireless controller featuring Samus Aran and a galactic background. You can also grab a pair of wired Metroid-themed earbuds packaged in a drawstring bag with Metroid artwork. Nintendo Switch 2 owners can snag a $20 carrying case with Metroid Prime 4 key art, and there's a crossbody bag with Metroid Prime Trilogy artwork for original Switch consoles.

Guess what my favorite cereal was as a kid. Yup, it was Cap’n Crunch, so you can understand why I was so excited to see this fun Hyperkin Cap’n Crunch Wireless Bluetooth Controller. The fact that it’s also 45% off makes it even better!
Buy the Hyperkin Cap’n Crunch Wireless Bluetooth Controller for just $21.99 ($18 off)
This offer is available from Woot, a deals website owned by Amazon. Please note that it doesn’t come with a full manufacturer’s warranty. Instead, you’ll get a 90-day warranty directly from Woot.
The Hyperkin Cap’n Crunch Wireless Bluetooth Controller is way too fun and fabulous! It will undoubtedly spark plenty of conversations and smiles at first sight. Don’t be fooled by its light-hearted nature, though. This is actually a pretty capable gamepad.
To start, it’s compatible with a wide range of devices and services. These include the Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch OLED, Windows, Mac, Steam, and even Tesla! Of course, Android and iOS are both in the list, too.
It supports Bluetooth wireless technology, so you can use it without wires at up to 30 feet from the device. USB is obviously an option, though, if you prefer improved performance. You’ll get a 20-hour battery life, as well as a Turbo function.
This is a limited-edition product, and items usually make it to Woot once they are starting to sell out. I would take advantage of this deal sooner rather than later.
This is a limited edition, so you might want to jump on this deal soon. Consider that products usually make it to Woot once companies want to move remaining stock. Once it’s gone, it’s not coming back. Woot mentions that the offer will last for five more days or “until sold out.”

Blue Origin’s NASA Launch to Mars Is a Shot across the Bow for SpaceX
After delays, Jeff Bezos’ rocket company successfully launched a NASA mission to study Mars on Thursday.
By Claire Cameron edited by Lee Billings

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!
Blue Origin successfully launched — and partially landed — the company’s New Glenn rocket Thursday, marking a major step forward in its bid to rival SpaceX as a reliable provider of reusable rockets for NASA and other government agencies.
The rocket took off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 3:55 P.M. EST loaded up with NASA’s ESCAPADE mission to study how space weather impacts Mars. Somewhat ironically, space weather was also the cause of the mission’s latest delays, as a severe solar storm on Wednesday made conditions in Earth orbit too risky to attempt a planned launch. The rocket’s reusable first stage, dubbed “Never Tell Me the Odds,” touched back down minutes later on a Blue Origin drone ship — a first for the company.
New Glenn’s flight represented a test for Blue Origin, which has long sought to compete with SpaceX’s fully reusable rockets, which dominate the global launch market. During New Glenn’s inaugural flight in January this year, the company failed to land the first stage on their oceanic barge. After today’s successful landing, Blue Origin is much better positioned to win lucrative launch contracts — including some that have recently been put back on the table for NASA’s upcoming moon missions that had originally gone to SpaceX.

Elon Musk’s rocket company is lagging behind on development for its Starship megarocket, which NASA had hoped to use to ferry astronauts to and from lunar orbit to the moon’s surface as part of the Artemis III mission slated for 2027. However, in October, Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said the agency would reopen competition for the mission’s crewed lander — creating a potential opening for Blue Origin and other aerospace firms.
Days ahead of Thursday’s launch, Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp said that the company “would move heaven and Earth” to help NASA meet its goal of returning people to the moon as soon as possible.
