Some of the best opportunities in the market next year might have nothing to do with the AI trade.
That's the view at Goldman Sachs Asset Management sees a handful of areas of the market that could benefit as the rally in mega-cap tech broadens out, Greg Calnon, the cohead of public investing at the bank's asset management arm, said. 
The outlook for markets generally looks strong going into next year for risk assets, Calnon told CNBC this week, pointing to tailwinds like the Fed continuing to cut interest rates.
That's already started to benefit areas of the market this year that are out of the spotlight, he suggested, pointing to three spots in particular that could be good opportunities for investors as the pool of market winners broadens. 
Here are some of the bank's investment ideas going into the next year:
Small-cap companies are at the ""front lines"" of the artificial intelligence boom, despite most of the attention being paid to the hyperscalers, Calnon said.
That's because many small firms are positioned to compete in ""niche markets,"" he said, referring to how small companies aren't trying to go head-to-head with some of the largest spenders in the AI trade.
Valuations are also attractive relative to large-cap stocks, he added.
The Russell 2000 index is up 11.3% year-to-date.
""I think there's a lot of opportunities here,"" Calnon said, adding that he believed small firms were driving ""a lot of innovation.""
Healthcare is one small sector of the market that seems to be benefiting in part due to the hype for AI, Calnon suggested. He pointed to signs the rally was already started to broaden out to the sector, with the iShares US Healthcare ETF up 14.5% year-to-date.
""You're seeing that with the AI healthcare piece,"" Calnon said of investment opportunities in specific sectors of the S&P 500. ""Definitely healthcare being the tip of that spear.""
The market rally has already broadened out to international stocks this year, which ahve outperformed the US equity market, Calnon noted. The Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund ETF is up 26.8% year-to-date.
In a previous note to clients, Goldman Sachs said it believed international stocks would widely outpace the performance of the US stock market over the next 10 years.
The S&P 500 is expected to return just 6.5% a year over the next decade, per the bank's calculations, compared to the 10% annualized gains in emerging markets and most Asian stocks.
""It doesn't need to be at the expense of the US. But I think we've been so caught up in, it's the US or nothing, that other markets can participate,"" he said.

Computer maker HP is joining the growing list of companies that are conveniently announcing company-wide AI initiatives and plans to cut thousands of jobs at the same time.
HP shared on Tuesday that it expects to scale artificial intelligence within the company and lay off about 4,000-6,000 employees by the end of 2028. With roughly 56,000 employees, that comes up to a 10% workforce reduction.
âLooking forward, we are taking decisive actions to mitigate recent cost headwinds and are investing in AI-enabled initiatives to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction, and boost productivity,” HP CFO Karen Parkhill said in the press release. Per the Guardian, the cuts will be centered around the product development, internal operations, and customer support teams.
It’s safe to say that 2025 has so far been dominated by the question of whether or not AI is leading to mass unemployment.
The job market is grim. Companies are cutting back on hiring new employees, while some are laying off hundreds to make investors happy in the next earnings report.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in September that although there is still great uncertainty, he believes that AI is “probably a factor” in the dramatic slowdown in hiring, particularly when it comes to young graduates who are facing a particularly concerning unemployment situation.
There have been studies to back this phenomenon up as well. A Stanford study from August found that workers aged 22 to 25 in the most AI-exposed jobs were hit hardest by a decline in employment. Many deem the jobs that are easiest to automate are those that would be done by young graduates. Experts have voiced concerns over the impact this will have on society as a whole, as less early career work would mean that the next generation of the workforce won’t receive crucial training.
Even without the studies, companies have been openly and even proudly pointing the finger at AI as the reason why they are laying people off or just not hiring as much.
Online learning platform Chegg laid off 45% of its workforce recently, citing “new realities of AI” as a factor. Amazon slashed 14,000 white-collar jobs, first seemingly pointing the finger at the “transformative technology” of AI before claiming days later that the cuts were not financially nor AI-driven.
Many executives, like Shopify CEO Tobias LÃ¼tke and Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn, have also been clear about their wish to reduce hiring in favor of automation. PwC global chairman told BBC last week that the company had scrapped plans it made in 2021 to hire 100,000 people by 2026, because “now we have artificial intelligence.”
Still, though, some experts dispute that premise.
âItâs much harder to implement AI in a firm than people realize,â Robert Seamans, New York University professor of management and organizations, told Gizmodo in August. âFirms donât typically have the in-house talent thatâs needed to train, operate, and oversee whatever AI they implement, and so until you have the personnel in place that have that expertise, itâs going to be really hard to rely heavily on AI.â
An MIT report from August can back this up: corporate AI pilots are not as good as they seem at generating actual revenue gains.
Seamans believes that at least some of these companies are actually using AI as a scapegoat for layoffs that stem from things like economic uncertainty or tariffs, which are “much harder to blame.”
Meanwhile, Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar called the “all-powerful-AI-taking-over-jobs” narrative a Silicon Valley “fundraising shtick,” in a recent conversation with the New York Times.
Author Cory Doctorow, on the other hand, thinks that AI is unable to successfully replace many workers but bosses, and specifically tech bosses, “love the story” as a means to terrify workers into working more and complaining less (since, hypothetically, an AI chatbot could do all that work and not have to take breaks).
“It gives them a chance to put them in their place,” Doctorow said in a talk last month.

2,2025-11-26,"India is set to become Marriott International's next big growth bet.
The hotel chain's chief commercial officer, John Toomey, said in an interview with Business Insider that Marriott is looking to double its footprint in India, from 48 to 90 cities.
India ""is an absolutely exploding economy and democracy,"" said Toomey, who has worked at Marriott for nearly three decades.
In his current role, Toomey oversees over 650 Marriott-run hotels in the Asia Pacific, excluding China. He said Marriott has over 150 hotels in the pipeline in India, in addition to the 160 hotels it operates now.
Marriott's growth in India follows several analysts' reports in recent years, talking about travel having growth potential in the subcontinent.
McKinsey said in a 2023 report that India's fast-growing economy would help position it as an ""important global source market for leisure travel.""
Toomey said India holds a ""tremendous growth opportunity"" for Marriott.
""A large, young, and increasingly affluent population, coupled with government investments in infrastructure and connectivity, is driving both domestic and international tourism,"" he said. ""We see strong demand from middle- and upper-class travelers, who are seeking premium experiences across the country.""
Domestic travelers make up the bulk of Marriott's customer base in India, he said, adding that tourism in India is expected to boom over the next decade.
And Marriott is not just betting on big metropolitan cities.
""While we continue to strengthen our presence in major cosmopolitan hubs such as Mumbai, New Delhi, and Bangalore, we are equally committed to expanding into tier two and three cities through initiatives like Series by Marriott, which is set to add 115 properties to our portfolio,"" he said.
""Series by Marriott"" is a collection of independent and regional hotel brands that have been brought under the Marriott umbrella. It was launched in May.
Toomey also said Marriott's plans for India were largely driven by developments in the country's infrastructure and travel industry.
""I remember a time, maybe 10 years ago, when they had 50 airports. They are at 150 airports, and they are going to add another 200,"" he said.
One of the biggest challenges of operating in India is the country's diversity. India has 28 states and eight union territories, with over 100 languages spoken across the country. Its landscape ranges from deserts and tropical jungles to snowcapped mountains.
""There is no one-size-fits-all approach; each region, city, and even property may require a tailored approach to meet guest expectations,"" he said.
Toomey's comments come as the Indian travel market looks set to boom in the years to come.
""If India follows China's outbound travel trajectory (which it could, due to similarity in population size and per capita income trajectory), then Indian tourists could make 80 million to 90 million trips a year by 2040,"" McKinsey wrote in 2023, adding that Indian tourists had made 13 million trips in 2022.
In 2022, Morgan Stanley said in a report that India's consumption of goods and services, including leisure and recreation, would double to $4.9 trillion, from $2 trillion in 2022, by the end of the decade.
An estimated 1.4 billion tourists traveled internationally in 2024, an 11% increase from 2023, per UN Tourism's World Tourism Barometer. UN Tourism said it expected international tourism arrival numbers to grow by 3% to 5% this year.
Toomey told Business Insider that Marriott's plans for India aren't coming at the expense of other Asian markets such as China.
""I wouldn't say it's over for China. At the start of the decade, China was a big bet, and it still is today,"" he said.
""China remains one of the top source markets for travelers heading to countries like Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, you name it,"" he added.
Toomey said Marriott's expansion plans for India were inspired by what they had learned from operating in the Chinese market.
""I feel that India is in a similar position to where China was 10 to 15 years ago,"" he said.
""When you look at the budding population of 1.4 billion people surpassing China's, and a democracy that gives its citizens the freedom to travel where they want, we just feel that India is going to be massive,"" he continued.
Besides increasing its number of hotels, Toomey said Marriott has been broadening its partnerships with local partners in India. This includes launching a co-branded hotel credit card with India's HDFC Bank. In August, Marriott announced a joint loyalty program with the Indian e-commerce giant, Flipkart.

3,2025-11-26,"Beef prices are going up. Per recent reporting from Fox Business, industry leaders anticipate a top cost of $10 per pound by 2026. Yet, people's craving and appreciation for steak isn't going anywhere. Rather than heading out to a steakhouse (where business is, admittedly, also booming), many consumers are looking to their local grocery stores for steaks to prepare at home. It's easy to walk into a grocery store and find a full list of different cuts of steak, but what's less straightforward is assessing quality while shopping. Truth be told, some grocery stores are better to buy steak from than others.
When compiling this guide to steak quality by grocery chains, we identified the in-house steaks brands each grocery chain sources and sells as private label items. Beef or meat brands with larger footprints (take Tyson, for example) didn't factor in very heavily. We also took into consideration whether or not a chain has significant offerings from local or small-scale beef producers as well. Mostly, this guide centers on how shoppers feel about these private label steaks from popular grocery chains. 
Kicking off our list of best grocery store steak selections is the one and only: Kroger. Synonymous with Midwestern groceries, Kroger is the go-to store for a large portion of the American population. Luckily, it's also home to one of the highest-quality lines of steak from any grocery chain — the Kroger Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic line.
Simple Truth, one of the store's private labels, uses beef sourced from Uruguay, which has a more favorable climate for grass-fed and finished cows to graze on year-round. With Simple Truth, the livestock has a diet that is almost exclusively grass. Kroger refrains from using beef where hormones or antibiotics have been administered, resulting in natural meat without sacrificing flavor. In Uruguay, much of the cattle are Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cows. The latter is a hardy breed, while the former is known for superior marbling. You can widely see the difference in the quality of product Kroger sells. 
Although the reviews on its in-house branded steaks are mixed depending on the store, the Private Selection is reviewed well across the board, reaching at least three and a half stars on each steak (with many rated between four and five stars). The chain offers a variety of different cuts, including choice beef shoulder steak, top round London broil beef steak, beef choice skirt steak, sirloin tip beef, choice tailless beef strip steak, T-bone steak, eye of round beef steak, and cubed beef steak. It may not be the very best steak available in grocery stores, but it's well above most others and is deserving of a try next time you find yourself in one of the many Kroger locations.
Trader Joe's, known for its eclectic inventory and cheap pricing, is also home to some of the best-quality steaks you'll find in grocery stores. Although the cuts Trader Joe's has carried have always contained a solid amount of USDA Choice graded slabs, it has updated its selection to be even better. As of 2025, its stock has been updated to include filet mignon, ribeye, and New York strip steaks (all of which are graded as the second-highest grade for meat possible: Choice). 
The store also offers selections between pure pre-packaged cuts, organic grass-fed angus, and pre-marinated cuts (including, but not limited to, craft beer sirloin, carne asada,  balsamic rosemary, and sesame teriyaki). It give the meat selection a versatility no matter what the meal you're making, with options that can fit many  styles of cooking. 
While it may not have quite as high a quality as a store like Costco (which has its own processing and packaging process), for the value and size of steaks that Trader Joe's offers, it's one of the best deals on steak in any grocery store. According to shoppers, the lean tenderness of filet mignon and craft beer sirloin are the best options, as they both have solid five-star reviews. Shoppers in the Reddit group r/traderjoes agree that the store's steak is better than most other grocers. While steak may not be the first thing you think of when hearing of Trader Joe's, it should absolutely be one of the first things you put in your cart on your next visit.  
Publix grocery store (found primarily in the southeast) makes a comittment to supporting local farmers, and regularly procures meat from regional ranches. Sources are found from beef purveyors like Prestage Farm of North Carolina, and White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia. Nationally, it receives beef from Verde Farms, a regenerative farming-focused operation, which emphasizes environmental preservation and humane treatment of livestock. The store's meat counters are regularly stocked with a multitude of USDA Choice-graded cuts. 
The quality comes through in the house brand, GreenWise private label, and the line of meat sold under it. The animals raised for the GreenWise program are fed exclusively vegetarian diets, with no added hormones or antibiotics, resulting in more succulent meats packed with flavor. This, in large part, is due to its local sourcing, as 
Although the brand sells a variety of meats, including different kinds and variations of chicken, turkey, pork, and lamb, the steak is the clear standout, as its flavor is consistently second-to-none. While the store's website doesn't offer customer reviews for its particular products, the Reddit group r/publix concurs that the steak is of better quality than similar stores, and the store itself largely receives high ratings on Yelp.  
While Costco is generally known as a place to get bulk items for much cheaper prices, it has some departments that stand out for consistently having quality items (such as whiskies) that some customers go specifically to find. Its meat selection, particularly its steaks, fits perfectly in this category, as customers are always treated to a wide selection of high-quality cuts. USDA Prime (the highest quality beef can achieve) cuts are abundant and are defined by more marbling, tenderness, and flavor than USDA Choice or Select. 
While Costco sources its veal from Atlantic Veal and Lamb of New York (a source from more than 100 American farms), its beef primarily comes from California farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. It also sources from Iowa Premium and Snake River Farms, the former of which sources from over 1,200 local farmers, and the latter provides quality wagyu beef. Costco does not stock organic beef that's been fed hormones and/or antibiotics, but this isn't the biggest driver of their meat. The store uses a blade tenderizer when working its steaks, which (aside from a more thorough tenderization) severs the muscle and tissue more cleanly than other processes. This creates cleaner and better quality cuts, which leads to better quality steaks (even if they source their beef from similar places as their competitors) that are consistently rated four stars or more by their customers.
One of the more common grocery stores in America, Meijer offers a high-quality steak selection to a wide customer base. The chain sources its meats from Certified Angus Beef, Purely Meat, Grass Run Farms, Niman Ranch, Pre Brands, and other regional-based distributors, which has led to consistently well-reviewed cuts by their customers. When visiting the website, almost every cut of steak has a rating of four stars or higher (out of five).
Both Certified Angus Beef and Purely Meat are major factors in the higher quality of Meijer's steaks, as the latter helped not only to keep operations moving during COVID-19 (when many other suppliers were shut down), but to raise the overall quality of the meat the store carries. As of today, the store carries some of the most consistently highly rated steaks of any grocer. With there being Meijer locations across the country, you can't go wrong stopping in for some sincerely splendid slabs of steak.
Known for its cheap prices compared to its competitors, Aldi doesn't let this keep it from stocking its shelves with quality products. Aldi steak, for example, comes in multiple delicious cuts that can be found for noticeably cheaper than similar cuts at other stores. This isn't because its beef is of worse quality, but that Aldi has carved out a way to obtain and package meat that goes around the issues their competitors face. 
For example, per Daily Meal rather than sourcing all its meat for stores from one or a small few places, Aldi opts to obtain meat from local farms and distributors. Doing so helps to avoid the costs that go along with shipping, as well as to avoid any added preservatives. 
The store also stocks private-label products for a large portion of its meat selection, which means it orders meat from a third-party source and sells it under its own name. This helps to reduce costs for things such as marketing, paying an in-house butcher, and (again) shipping and the maintenance associated with it, as well as allowing more specificity when placing orders. Although Aldi's lower meat prices can cause skepticism over the quality of its products, its steak is not to be missed. Despite the store not providing direct customer feedback for individual items on its site, its steak is regularly considered to be high quality by shoppers (despite its lower price tag). Some on Reddit have even called the marbling of Aldi steak ""supreme.""
Sprouts is the banner holder of a more uniquely granola-type of grocery store, and that brings in many shoppers, who choose it religiously. Although all its food is high quality, the steak selection is the best of any grocery store in America. It sources its steak from Grass Run Farms, which provides grass-fed Angus steaks that are more marbled and succulent than your typical grocer's in-house steaks. Sprouts offers a selection of grass-fed, pasture-raised, and pre-prepared/ready-to-cook varieties, while emphasizing fresh, not frozen, meat, and a butcher counter that can assist with any questions or requests that you may have. 
Sprouts ranked as Tasting Table's top grocery store for meat for a reason, as the care to both source the best meat and provide the best cuts to its customers has resulted in the best overall selection of any grocery store. We've even recommended that Sprouts be your go-to for all meats, not just steak, which lends to the overall quality of the store. Its selections include a variety of cuts for whatever you may be making, including from the chuck/brisket/shank, the ribs/plate, the loin/flank, and the round/top round. While there is a bit more effort required to acquire a cut of steak from Sprouts (due to the higher pricing and lack of store presence outside the Southern states), it's well worth it, as these are some of the best cuts available in grocery stores today and have an overwhelming majority of five-star reviews on most of their in-house steaks. 
Each selection on this list has to be the store's own brand or label, and not products that can specifically be found in other stores. So while stores may source from the same suppliers, each store has its own processing/packaging processes that contribute to the varying qualities between different stores.
They also had to be generally well reviewed by customers, so if a store has one or two cuts of steaks that are highly rated, but most are rated three stars or less, then it would not be included. Conversely, if a store has certain cuts that have been occasionally rated negatively, but that are widely well reviewed by customers, it isn't entirely discounted from being included.
 As mentioned, each store has its own processes for steak procurement and processing, which will lead to the inevitable missteps from time to time. The stores included in this list were ranked based on where and how they source meats, overall customer reviews, and (when necessary) value provided to the customer compared to competitors."

It can handle the tasks you'd expect, including multiple Google Chrome tabs with applications running in the background. It also has an upgraded 12-MP webcam and a few different ports, including a headphone jack. We do recommend going for upgraded unified memory if you're a power user, and while it can handle some photo editing or other content creation, it's probably not the best choice if you'll be editing videos or other graphics-intensive tasks.

The entry-level tracker has onboard GPS, blood oxygen monitoring, and all the fitness metrics you'll need, including those that Garmin is known for (such as Training Readiness). AI fitness insights are useful, but you'll need a subscription to access them, though we don't think it's necessary if you don't want to pay $70 per year for it.

It has balanced performance, with natural-looking colors and great black levels. It's not the brightest on the market, but if you don't need an ultra-bright TV, it should perform well. The gaming features, Google TV interface, and Google Assistant are icing on the cake. Just make sure to pair it with a soundbar, as the built-in speakers aren't great.

I've tested more than 10 different down comforters and down alternatives, and Quince remains my very favorite. It has that classic, crinkly, luxurious, fluffy quality that immediately leaves you feeling cozy. It's loud enough to rustle pleasantly, but not so loud that it'll disturb your partner if you shuffle around in your sleep. It's also warm without being heavy, so you can use it year-round. It's a very well-rounded pick that should suit you no matter your sleep style or climate.

Madison Avenue's makeover is taking shape.
Omnicom officially completed its acquisition of Interpublic Group on Wednesday, in a $9 billion all-stock deal that creates the largest advertising agency holding company by revenue. The combined company will generate annual revenue exceeding $25 billion, Omnicom said.
The agency mega-merger, first announced in December, creates a portfolio that unites creative networks such as BBDO and McCann, media buying agencies including OMD and Initiative, and the Omni and Acxiom data platforms.
In a statement, Omnicom CEO John Wren, who will lead the merged company, said the acquisition marks a ""defining moment for our company and our industry.""
""With the completion of the deal, Omnicom is setting a new standard for modern marketing and sales leadership — creating stronger brands, delivering superior business outcomes, and driving sustainable growth,"" Wren said.
Omnicom said it will announce its full leadership team on December 1.
The deal reflects the changing fortunes of Madison Avenue. The holding company landscape, once referred to as the big six — Omnicom, IPG, WPP, Publicis Groupe, Dentsu, and Havas — has now become five.
One of the theories behind the deal is that being bigger is the best strategy. By merging, Omnicom-IPG can reduce operating costs by consolidating systems, while also leveraging its collective client ad spending from the world's biggest brands to negotiate better deals with media owners and tech platforms.
However, some industry insiders have said that the deal also highlights how the power of holding companies is being challenged by the emergence of new technologies and competitors. Technology such as generative AI has made it easier for marketers to in-house some of the work they used to outsource to agencies. Newer entrants to the space, including consulting firms, private equity-backed ad networks, and independent agencies, are all vying for marketers' budgets. Marketers, facing macroeconomic pressures such as tariffs and high interest rates, are pushing agencies to produce more work at the same or lower budgets.
""The industry in general is under attack because clients are finding more efficient ways to make content at scale,"" said Greg Paull, president of global growth at the media advisory firm MediaSense.
Even the sector's star performer, Publicis, buoyed by several significant new business wins in recent months, including Mars and Coca-Cola's North American media account, has seen its market value drop by around 19% year-to-date.
Omnicom's share price has also fallen sharply since the IPG deal was first announced late last year, causing the transaction to drop from an initial valuation of roughly $13 billion. Omnicom shareholders will own around 61% of the combined company, with Interpublic shareholders owning about 39%.
Agency layoffs have been a constant at companies across the advertising sector. Steve Boehler of the consulting firm Mercer Island Group expects the Omnicom merger will lead to 20,000 job cuts at the combined company, including the layoffs IPG has already made this year.
Industry analysts anticipate further ad agency consolidation in the coming months.
Japan-based Dentsu is restructuring its international business — everything outside Japan — which could include a potential sale. Speculation has swirled around the future of WPP amid a recent run of poor financial performance, with newly appointed CEO Cindy Rose tasked with bringing about a turnaround. Earlier this month, media reports suggested Havas was eyeing a bid for WPP. Havas CEO Yannick Bolloré later said in an internal memo, ""We are not in discussions with WPP."" Industry insiders and analysts have also predicted that advertising companies will continue to be a target for private-equity giants and consulting firms.
As Omnicom works through the intricacies of its merger to deliver the margins expected by investors, competitors could look to seize the opportunity.
""It'll look like an interesting time where there are fewer big holding company brands, leaving space in the market for PE-backed and large successful independents to continue to merge and do a better job of attacking that middle-market where there's so much business that isn't getting senior-level attention from the holding companies,"" Boehler said.

For many people (especially those living in compact city apartments), we know square footage is a luxury. When every inch counts, a bulky desktop tower isnât always practical. If your desk canât accommodate a full-size PC, the best solution is to streamline your workspace with a smaller computer that still delivers the performance you need. Come check out KAMRUIâs line of mini PCs. Right now, the companyâs Hyper H2 mini gaming PC is available at a steep 38% discount, dropping the price from $820 to just $510. Thatâs a savings of $310 for a limited time.
See at Amazon
See at Amazon

The KAMRUI Hyper H2 is marketed as a compact gaming machine, but does it have the specs to back that up? Inside the small chassis, the device runs on an 11th-generation Intel Core i7 mobile processor with 10 cores and boost speeds up to 4.9GHz. It also includes 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, giving you plenty of memory and fast storage from the start. If you need even more space, the internal storage can be expanded up to 4TB with a compatible SSD. KAMRUI claims the Hyper H2 can juggle large AAA games, 3D rendering, and video editing. While that may be a stretch considering it relies on integrated graphics, the system should still be capable of handling moderately demanding titles. Games like Fortnite or Marvel Rivals should run reasonably wellâas long as youâre not aiming for maxed-out settings.





Part of the appeal of the Hyper H2 is its physical design. The system sports a sleek silver-white metal exterior, giving it a modern and stylish look that fits well on small desks or media cabinets. Despite its compact footprint, KAMRUI packs in an impressive number of ports. The unit includes six USB-A 3.2 ports for connecting keyboards, mice, controllers, external drivesâyou name it. You also get a USB-C port, an HDMI port, and a DisplayPort, allowing support for up to three monitors simultaneously. The Hyper H2 can output resolutions up to 4K at 120Hz, which is ideal for productivity tasks, media consumption, andâof courseâvideo games. For connectivity, it comes equipped with Wi-Fi 6, Gigabit Ethernet, and Bluetooth 5.2 support.
With such a small PC, you might be concerned with how it handles heat management. Because of its a small form factor, itâs reasonable to expect higher temperatures during intensive tasks. To combat this, KAMRUI has built the Hyper H2 with a silent centrifugal cooling fan and dual copper heat pipes. This setup aims to improve heat dissipation while keeping fan noise down, helping the system maintain stable performance during long gaming sessions or demanding workloads.
If youâre looking for a gaming-capable PC that wonât dominate your workspace, the KAMRUI Hyper H2 offers a great bang for your buck. For a limited time, you can pick it up for just $510, nearly half off its original cost.

9,2025-11-26,"Counterpoint Research is predicting Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup will help it nudge Samsung out as the number one phone manufacturer in the world this year, as reported by CNBC and Bloomberg. The report estimates Apple will ship 243 million phones this year, whil…"
10,2025-11-26,"Apple is set to reclaim the title of world's largest smartphone maker for the first time since 2011, driven by the success of the iPhone 17 lineup, according to Counterpoint Research data (via Bloomberg).
Based on the firm's data, iPhone shipments are projected to grow 10% in 2025, easily outpacing Samsung's 4.6% growth. As a result, Apple is expected to capture a 19.4% global market share as the overall smartphone market expands 3.3% for the year.
The iPhone 17 series has posted double-digit year-over-year sales growth in both the U.S. and China. Counterpoint previously reported that the iPhone 17 lineup outsold iPhone 16 models by 14% during the first 10 days of availability in those markets, and that Apple had a record October in China with sales jumping 37% year-over-year. 
Apple is also benefiting from easing U.S.-China trade tensions and a weaker dollar that has boosted purchases in emerging markets.
Counterpoint analyst Yang Wang said the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook was a replacement cycle ""inflection point,"" as consumers who bought phones during the pandemic boom are now ready to upgrade. Wang noted that 358 million secondhand iPhones were sold between 2023 and Q2 2025, representing another pool of potential upgraders.
Looking ahead, Wang expects Apple to extend its lead with the 2026 launch of its first foldable iPhone and a budget-friendly iPhone 17e, followed by a major iPhone design overhaul in 2027, in celebration of the device's 20th anniversary.

A fresh warning is raising questions about how aggressively the industry should pursue autonomous superintelligence.
Amid that concern, the industry must rethink how it approaches frontier systems, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) artificial intelligence chief Mustafa Suleyman recently told the ""Silicon Valley Girl Podcast.""
""It would be very hard to contain something like that or align it to our values. And so that should be the anti-goal,"" he said.

Suleyman told host Marina Mogilko autonomous superintelligence — a system able to self-improve, set its own goals, and act independently of humans — ""doesn't feel like a positive vision of the future.""
He said such a system would be difficult to control and its independence would create risks the industry should avoid.
Suleyman, best known for co-founding Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL, GOOG)) Google DeepMind unit, said his team is working on a ""humanist superintelligence."" He described it as a model designed to operate in service of human interests, offering support rather than replacing human judgment.
He also addressed claims that AI may deserve moral status or consciousness. ""These things don't suffer. They don't feel pain,"" he said. He added that current models are ""just simulating high-quality conversation,"" not experiencing emotion or self-awareness.
Trending: 7 Million Gamers Already Trust Gameflip With Their Digital Assets — Now You Can Own a Stake in the Platform
Suleyman's comments come as other technology leaders outline their own expectations for advanced systems. Their projections come as companies report rapid progress in training infrastructure, model performance and global investment.
Earlier this year, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in his blog that superintelligent tools could advance scientific discovery far beyond human ability and increase abundance and prosperity.
Altman also told the German newspaper Die Welt in September that he would be ""very surprised"" if superintelligence does not emerge by 2030. His timeline has featured prominently in recent discussions about advanced AI systems.
Google DeepMind co-founder Demis Hassabis offered his own timeline in April when he told Time magazine AGI could be achieved ""in the next five to 10 years."" He described future systems as being ""embedded in everyday lives"" and having the ability to understand the world ""in nuanced ways.""

However, one leading researcher continues to encourage caution. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said at the World Economic Forum in January that current AI systems cannot reason, plan, or understand the physical world, and that human-level AI will require an entirely new paradigm.
He also said during an April talk at the National University of Singapore that ""most interesting problems scale extremely badly,"" adding that, in his view, simply increasing data and compute does not solve the underlying limitations of current systems.

12,2025-11-26,"Apple is fighting an antitrust penalty law in India that could require it to pay massive fines in its ongoing antitrust dispute with Tinder owner Match, reports Reuters.
Last year, India passed a law that allows the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to use global turnover when calculating penalties imposed on companies for abusing market dominance. Apple can be fined up to 10 percent, which would result in a penalty of around $38 billion. Apple said that using global turnover would result in a fine that's ""manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, and unjust.""
Apple is asking India's Delhi High Court to declare the law illegal, suggesting that penalties should be based on the Indian revenue of the specific unit that violates antitrust law.
Apple has been fighting an antitrust lawsuit in India since 2022 against dating app Match and several Indian startups. The CCI released a pair of reports last year suggesting that Apple had engaged in ""abusive conduct and practices"" because it required developers to use its in-app purchase system. The CCI was forced to recall its investigative reports because they contained confidential information about Apple's business practices, resulting in a delay of several months. No final decision has been made, and a penalty has yet to be levied against Apple. Apple maintains that it has not done anything wrong, and argues that it has a very small share of the smartphone market in India because Android devices are much more popular.
Apple said in today's filing that the CCI used the new penalty law on November 10 in an unrelated case, fining a company for a violation that happened 10 years ago. Apple said it had ""no choice but to bring this constitutional challenge now"" to avoid having retrospective penalties applied against it, too.
Match has argued that a high fine based on global turnover would discourage companies from repeating antitrust violations. Apple's plea will be heard on December 3.

You can't rely on a huge and unreliable trade partner with interests that might not align with yours.  That's the new reality, sadly.  And the world will be poorer for the pigheaded (if not bloodthirsty) pursuit of power and influence on the part of the USA, China and Russia.
Except that in the case of Canada, there was a great deal of trade in both directions, in terms of commodities and also finished goods. It was a mutually beneficial trade arrangement too.  It promoted the US' interests without ham-fisted authoritarian threats.  This sort of trade made the US the powerhouse it was.  In other words this was a sharp shift in US government attitude from one of friendship to one of an adversary (which is really how all relationships and business deals have ever been done in Trump's life).  Sadly there's no going back.  The damage is done and the  US will never ever recover the good will and trade benefits it once had with its closest allies and trading partners, no matter what a future Democrat does to try to undo the damage, now that Trump's attitude has become the attitude of the GOP.
With China, though, there was no abrupt shift.  China's goals have always been clear.  The only thing they want from the west in terms of trade is raw commodities and foreign currencies.  Whereas the west demands cheap goods, full stop.  So China's domination of European industry and economies has been ongoing for years, and it's benefited by European policy and attitudes.  China is happy to build high quality items and sell them for a premium, but there's no very little demand from the west.  If there was demand, we wouldn't have seen local manufacturing capability disappear in the first place. Tariffs are not going to change these fact.

We have had too many ""smartest people in the room"" presenting complex technocratic solutions that are ultimately just houses of cards.I think that misses a central problem, their solutions are self-serving. They often ignore both the costs to other people and the restricted range of people like themselves who will benefit. The need for complex solutions is often driven by the need to protect their interests. An, d yes, the ACA is a classic example.

""increasingly large amounts of money being moved from the bottom to the top.""
Do the poor even have the $trillions that the rich want, or does it come from financial markets?
Why not deregulate financial markets and make taxes voluntary so you don't trigger adolescent rebellion in the rich, while printing and indexing a basic income so the poor have enough to live on and pursue their happiness?
Because that will not pacify the poor. Printing money constantly will cause monetary inflation, so only the rich will be able to buy anything of significant value like homes. You'd have to also give away housing. It makes much more sense just to take the money from the rich and give it to the poor, the rich will end up with it again anyway.
Printing money constantly will cause monetary inflation, so only the rich will be able to buy anything of significant value like homes.That is entirely wrong. We do in fact ""print"" money constantly. But ""printing"" additional money will cause ""inflation"" only if it is not accompanied by an increase in the value of what is available to purchase with that money.

Europe like America gives too much money to its 1%. The only way to maintain their economies is with cheap goods made by slave labor in China. That's the only way to offset increasingly large amounts of money being moved from the bottom to the top.If you want to fix that you have to cut off the flow of money to the top and we're not going to do that. There's a variety of terrible reasons why that is the case but it just is.An alternative view is that China's cheap imports benefit mainly the American masses.  The 1% can afford to pay extra to buy from anywhere, but the bottom 80% cannot.  However, since the US economy is largely consumer driven, the bottom 80% must be kept alive and buying in order to support the economy (particularly the stock market) for the 1% to maintain and grow their assets.

European manufacturers are facing a two-front assault from China that has German industry associations warning of deindustrialisation: on one side, artificially cheap Chinese goods are flooding into Europe, and on the other, Beijing has demonstrated its willingness to abruptly cut off access to critical inputs like rare earths and semiconductors.

Does China allow PFAS pesticides too?
Almost as if world trades were humming along just fine and someone decided to take a giant shit in the swimming pool. Now China has this rare earths license nonsense as a direct result of the USA.
World trade was headed to destruction. Now it's just heading there a bit quicker.
Europe will be ok.
It just needs to regulate some more, ban some more business practices, and keep telling everyone else about how awesome it is.
It will be just FINE!!!!
Now get out there and pass out some more fines!
The Trump administration seems to think so.   Increased government regulation through tariffs will fix it, along with bigger government.  Ironic how the GOP has done a complete 180 over the years isn't it.
If it does another 180, it will be a 360!
Wouldn't that be rad??
There is nothing that China wants to import, nothing it does not believe it can make better and cheaper,And the real problem for Europe may be that they are right. And that would mean that European industry is no longer competitive in the world market. And its not clear there is anything they can do about that.

Well it's a problem or the US too.  The last bastion of American industry is heavy equipment including construction and agricultural machines.  Interestingly this is also a prime industry for Europe too.  A lot of stuff is still made locally.  But China is now making their own versions and just beginning to exporting them. And it's a double whammy. They can make them cheaper, but choose to just barely undercut western equivalent products (say by 20%), making a huge profit.

It still produces plenty of other goods and services that can't be easily produced better and cheaper elsewhere.

I feel like with all these stories about Windows 11 if you just replace the '11' with '8"" and you basically have the same story from that era with the same pitfalls of MS trying to force their big idea and consumer rejection.
8 was salvageable with just a few UI tweaks though (and 8.1 was perfectly serviceable).  11 has no redeeming qualities or actual improvements over 10; at least that the average PC user is even going to find useful or desirable.The thing MS is failing to realize that if you are the 800 pound gorilla, you can only throw your weight around so much before alternatives become increasingly attractive.
At this point I'd say there are just as many tweaks and modifiers for 11 today, it has been out awhile.  If you want 11 to pretty much act like 10 you can do that if you've got that same level of Windows know how.  StartAllBack, Winaero Tweaker, Rectify11, O+O Shutup.  For as long as Windows has been around there has been large communities who make it do what they want.
That said people are flocking to alternatives but more and more that alternative is Apple.
Really, the fact is that 7 was supported through Windows 8's whole run so it was easy to skip to 10.
Even if 11 has no major new features worth caring about it isn't such a dumpster fire of a GUI vs 8.  It's functional.
Problem is that it does have some features I care very much not to have.
Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities resulted in an initial 40% loss in I/O performance when the mitigations were put into place, and there were a bunch of additional vulnerabilities that had to be mitigated in the operating system.   Those mitigations could cause other problems down the line, so it makes sense that Microsoft didn't want to deal with those for Windows 11.   By cutting those older CPUs from the supported list, that made it a lot less of a headache when it comes to the code.
So sure, you can put Windows 11 on those older machines, but should they be supported?   If Microsoft adds something that doesn't work on older chips, people will complain a lot more about THAT than anything else.
So, setup.exe /product serverUpgrade to Windows 11, it's at your own risk.   25H2 I believe, does require a GPT partition scheme with EFI bootloader, which may not work on older machines.   People really don't understand the idea of, ""not supported"", and as a result, that also means, don't make it easy for the non-technical people to do it, because THEY will be the first ones to demand support because the installer worked on their old computer.   Oh, you need 16GB of RAM to run it well because the memory overhead is higher, well, more complaints by people who are still running Windows 10 with only 4GB of RAM.
 Those mitigations could cause other problems down the line, so it makes sense that Microsoft didn't want to deal with those for Windows 11.IOW: ""We've only got $3.5T in capital to work with, so this is just too hard for us to figure out. You'll have to switch to an OS made by unpaid volunteers.""

Working on the older machines and supporting it on those older machines are two very different things.   If Microsoft put a ""use at your own risk, this system is not supported"" on the screen, there are too many stupid people who would install it, then the moment they have a problem, they would be going to Microsoft to get help.   Linux being almost completely without paid support makes ""use at your own risk"" a given, but I've seen too many people who just assume that anyone offering help must be ""paid suppo 
A lot of people seem to not realize that windows 11 does in fact officially support all that older hardware. Fully.
The gating isn't hardware support. It's the license. To get officially supported version (that contains all the same driver packages, APIs, and layers), you need to get win11 IOT.
Good luck getting an official license for that instead of going the genocide burial route.
I don't know what they are talking about, the Linux market share did reach 3% and continuing to rise... and is set to break new record of adoption by the end of the year. Clearly they are doing something that is working great. Thank you Microsoft :D
I made the switch last year, and I couldn't go back to window anytime soon, everything work just fine with some compatibility layer or something, even Steam work fine. I just keep ignoring all these anxiety aggravating people who keep preaching the end of the world at the end of windows 10 support, and I've been sleeping better since then, the world haven't stop turning.
In fact, with the money I saved, I made a donation to the Mozilla fondation for Thunderbird.
Seriously, just ignore *them*. You'll thanks me later.
What are you talking about Jerry?
I have a question. In the past I've always avoided AMD video cards because of the driver issues I always read about. Over the past year however I have been reading that AMD Linux drivers are so much better than nVidia's drivers. I'm looking to upgrade my video card, and since I use Linux now, would it be wise for me to try an AMD video card this time around? Are the drivers really that much better?
Yes, AMD drivers are more stable and more likely to ""just work"" out of the box than Nvidia drivers.
nVidias Linux driver's are crap. Constant breakage and problems with sleeping. X with Nvidia and kde is basically a total loss at this point. AMD drivers ""just work"" for all this. No breakage for half the kernel updates, abandonment to a million old sub branches for different hardware. Hi AMD for Linux, yeah.
One of the most insidious OS prompts I had ever seen.  A dialog box with two choices.  Update Now or Schedule for Later.
At the bottom of the window in tiny print was some blue text that said ""Don't Update"" and closing the window or clicking that tiny non-underlined hyperlink would not take any action except wait to pop up again.
In the EU, you can just click ""enroll"" and boom, Windows 10 is supported yet another year with security updates, and no need to worry about AI getting in the way (that much). AFAIK elsewhere you need to enable the stupid cloud backups, but with some tricks you can avoid that too.
I'm still running Win 10 Education, I got the license from my university via Dreamspark back when it was a thing, and now I enrolled also for ESUs for that. I should be covered until 2028.
(Migrated to Linux on most of my PCs, but using Windows for gaming. After 2028 I guess I'll migrate to Steam Deck).
Microsoft has been at the saturation point in most of their markets for many, many years. The only way forward is to strip mine the company until there's nothing left. They will likely follow the same playbook as IBM and sell off products to their ""trusted partner"" in India.
MS still has their other businesses to rely upon. The C-Suite is up to their assholes in Office, their cloud crap is still still there, and now business is getting all hot and bothered by AI and MS is right there promising it....whatever business wants AI to be, MS says AI is.
Don't confuse growth with finding new ways to trick customers into paying for an add-on subscription to a previously core feature.
Well, I *do* want an ""AI PC"", but not anything currently on the market.  I want one that will understand books in HTML format and read them to me in a reasonably expressive tone.  I'd also like it to be able to pause and then answer questions about what was going on earlier if I missed a point.OTOH, I'd also want it to be strictly segregated from most of what I do.
Well, I *do* want an ""AI PC"", but not anything currently on the market.  I want one that will understand books in HTML format and read them to me in a reasonably expressive tone.That part doesn't require AI at all. We're fairly close to it now, just need 3 small things I think.1. We need it to be expressive by honoring punctuation. Example, make ""!"" a little more excited; make ""?"" go up in pitch at the end; and pause appropriately for ""..."" and ""--"".2. We need something like tag attributes to help with voices, e.g. <span voice=1>""Are you sure, Jane?""</span> <span voice=2>""Yes Dick, I'm sure you need to run.""</span>And of course be able to define what voice 1

No.  It can't be properly expressive without understanding the story that it's reading.  Punctuation is just not enough, it doesn't capture many different shades of meaning.  E.g., an ironic statement should be read in a different tone than a factual statement, even with exactly the same punctuation.  (That's one example out of MANY.  Consider, e.g., the scene in ""Alice in Wonderland"" where she's talking about jumping off the top of the house.)
Linux and support...two very different things.   There's Redhat Enterprise, what other supported version of Linux is out there?   Just because volunteers may make things work doesn't mean there is true support for when things go wrong.
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server has 13 years LTS. SLES 16 released this month is planned to be supported through November 2038. https://www.suse.com/lifecycle... [suse.com]
Ubuntu just extended their LTS to 15 years. Microsoft could do it too if they wanted. When they realize no one wants ClippyPilot they will be forced to provide a traditional version of Windows again.LTS kernels are supported for two years. The Linux Civil Infrastructure Group support (just barely) certain LTS kernels for 10 years... I am dying to see who will support the kernel of ubuntu for 15 years.Or they will change the kernel at the end of the 10 years, which in turn means changes on the hardware and the upper layers of the software, while keeping the name of the distro the same, but you will end up doing an ""upgrade that is not called an upgrade"" and paying extra for the priviledge to call the upgrade the same fancy adjective-animal + version number as the old OS you had.

As they are comparin end of support of Win7 to end of support from Win10. Thing is, when support for Win7 ended, there was no ESU for users, and what's more, there was no Free-ish ESU for users. Meanwhile, Win10 has a (Free-ish) ESU for users.
So, the real comparison is to compare adoption of Win10 when Win7 reached end of support to adoption of Win11 when Win10's Free-ish ESU runs out, that is to say: Nov 2026
Everybody's saying that it's no surprise.
But, I'm very surprised to hear that there might be so many systems that are still not upgraded. We are already past the first patch cycle with no updates for Windows 10. If a major vulnerability is discovered with no patch and a weeks to months lead time for replacements and upgrades, the fallout will be catastrophic.
All the corporate networks that I'm familiar with have either refreshed, or are using ESUs as a stop gap for a few months. All that I'm familiar with a

OpenAI has committed more than $1.4 trillion that it will spend on building out its data center infrastructure to power the development and deployment of its AI models over the next eight years. Notably, OpenAI does not have $1.4 trillion. Also notable is the fact that the company doesn’t make that much money. That means it’ll remain reliant primarily on fundraising rounds to pay the bills as they come due. According to a report from the Financial Times, all OpenAI has to do is raise $207 billion by 2030 in order to keep operating at a deep loss. Easy peasy!
The report cites a recent analysis of OpenAI’s finances from HSBC, the British multinational financial services giant, which has taken into account the AI startup’s planned spending on infrastructure, compute, and energy costs, as well as its projected revenue to offset all those costs.
The bank estimates that OpenAI will run up a bill of $620 billion per year on data center costs, with a caveat that it has signed contracts for more computing power than is actually available at the moment. Then it created an estimate for the company’s customer reach, which is currently reported to be 800 million by OpenAI’s count and will reach three billion by 2030 under HSBC’s model. The bank generously estimates that OpenAI will convert 10% of that reach into paying customers, double its current rate of 5%. Those estimates are more generous than OpenAI’s reported internal ones, which have the company reaching 2.6 billion and converting 8.5% of them to paying subscribers by the end of the decade. HSBC also tosses OpenAI some advertising revenue under the assumption that LLM firms will take about 2% of the total digital ad market in the coming years.
With all that, HSBC projects that OpenAI will hit about $215 billion in annual revenue by 2030. That, once again, tops OpenAI’s own projections, which reportedly put it at about $200 billion annually by the end of the decade. Both models are calling for what is basically unprecedented growth, but let’s roll with it. Taking into account OpenAI’s current cash flow plus its projected expectation-busting growth projections would still leave the company with a funding deficit of $207 billion. Per HSBC, the company will need to raise that much just to continue operating in the red.
OpenAI has options to shrink that funding gap, though none of them are all that appealing. The company could back out of some of its data center commitments to shrink its expenditures, though it might not provide much comfort to investors who are counting on something closer to infinite growth. It could also blow past even the generous revenue projections made by HSBC, which seems unlikely and not really something it can just manufacture. If generating revenue were easy, the company would be doing it.
Then there’s the other option that OpenAI execs started floating before immediately getting push back: get a government bailout. Contingency plans usually aren’t a bad idea, but it probably doesn’t instill a whole lot of confidence that you’re planning on the possibility of failing so hard that you might drag the entire economy down with you.

16,2025-11-26,"Christie's is preparing to auction off the original partnership contract that created the Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, valuing it in the region of $2-4 million.  
The original three-page document served as the contract among Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ron Wayne. The agreement established initial shares at 45% for Jobs, 45% for Wozniak, and 10% for Wayne.
Additional papers documenting Wayne's withdrawal as a partner just 12 days after the company was formed are also included in the auction package. Wayne initially received $800 for his 10% share of the company, and later received an additional $1,500 payment.
Wayne later stated he withdrew because he knew the venture would be a ""roller coaster"" and that the high-stakes ride was not for him. 
If Wayne's original 10% stake had somehow remained untouched, it would be worth about $409 billion today based on Apple's $4 trillion valuation. That's only a playful comparison, mind, since decades of stock splits, new share issuances, and structural changes mean that early 10% slice has no realistic connection to Apple's modern share count!
Christie's will offer the founding contract and Wayne's withdrawal agreement as a single lot on January 23, 2026.
In the early 1990s, Wayne sold the physical copy of the founding contract for $500. Apple's founding corporate papers were last sold at auction by Sotheby's in December 2011. That lot also included Wayne's withdrawal, and it was sold to a private collector for nearly $1.6 million.

    Apple's first foldable could be an expensive one.
  
The first foldable iPhone could be less than a year away, and reportedly, you won't ever see a crease. You could, however, see a decent dent in your wallet.
According to a report by Chinese publication UDN, engineers have made ""breakthroughs"" in creating a ""crease-free design"" for the iPhone Fold, and the product cycle has now moved past the experimental stage to pre-mass production mode. The Fold reportedly could be launched in September 2026.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.
But you'll pay dearly for the iPhone's creaseless screen. Another report by Fubon Research says the iPhone Fold could cost as much as $2,399, which would make it the most expensive foldable phone on the market -- higher than the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the Samsung Galaxy Flip 7, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Motorola Razr Ultra and Motorola Razr, all which range between $700 and $2,000.
More from CNET: A Word of Warning to Apple About the Fold
The reported $2,400 price tag might pack a wallop, but so could the Fold's possibly game-changing design quality. The market has steadily grown since the first foldable phone was launched in 2018, but no one has yet been able to make one that doesn't show a crease after several folds. The OnePlus Open has the least visible crease of all the foldables -- there's even a subreddit extolling the virtues of its near-creaseless-ness. But a crease is still a crease.
Jessica Naziri, a content creator focused on tech made for women at TechSesh.co, says, ""2026 is the year of foldables.""
""We've been begging our phones to behave like laptops, and this gets us a lot closer to that reality,"" Naziri told CNET. ""If Apple is doing it, you know it will be good. Between the iPhone Air and the upcoming foldable, it's nice to finally see Apple trying new form factors.
Despite the high price, Naziri says consumers will still pony up. 
""Obviously, the engineering feat is expected to come with a premium price tag, and people will find a way to save up and pay up,"" she said.
The UDN report said that teams from Apple, NewRixing and Amphenol have been collaborating on key component bearings to avoid the iPhone Fold showing creases. Those teams have used high-strength hinge component technology made of liquid metal to improve folding durability, according to the report.
The inner screen is developed by Samsung Display, and the panel structure, material handling and lamination are designed by Apple, the report said. UDN also said that Taiwan-based Hon Hai Technology Group has created a production line where several dozen iPhone Fold devices will be initially manufactured for testing before mass production begins.
The advanced components and design work led to the hefty consumer cost, however. Fubon Research analyst Arthur Liao said the OLED panel, hinge and lightweight internals will help drive up the price of the iPhone Fold. He also said that RAM prices have risen 75% in the past year, and total material cost could go up between 5% and 7% in 2026 because of increased demand for chips, memory and storage."

AI darling Nvidia fell in trading Tuesday and continued a string of losses that began at the start of the month, conflicting with gains made by the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average after a report from The Information said Meta was considering a multibillion-dollar investment into Google artificial intelligence chips.
Nvidia shares closed down 2.6% and fell another half percent to $177.68 in after-hours trading.
The report, published Monday, said Meta was in talks with Google about using the Alphabet subsidiary’s processing units for AI within its data centers in 2027.
Google’s AI chip business for “high-frequency trading firms that run AI models in their facilities” could help the company snatch 10% of Nvidia’s annual revenue, according to The Information, which cited an unnamed person who spoke about conversations between leaders in Google’s cloud business.
Alphabet shares closed up 1.6% on Tuesday, continuing a strong month for the company’s stock, which has traded up 24.2% since the start of November.
Meanwhile, the Dow Jones climbed over 1%, the Nasdaq composite moved up 0.7% and the S&P 500 popped 0.9%, all continuing a three-day long rally.

The report noted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang could preempt a Meta-Google deal by striking his own arrangement with Meta, which already spends billions of dollars a year on Nvidia’s chips. Google is also catching up with Nvidia on a technical level when it comes to chips for AI inference, according to The Information. AI inference chips make decisions or recognize patterns based on data they have not yet seen, unlike chips used for AI training that use given datasets to identify patterns."

The Justice Department’s Antitrust Division filed a proposed settlement today to resolve the United States’ claims against RealPage Inc. as part of its ongoing enforcement against algorithmic coordination, information sharing, and other anticompetitive practices in rental housing markets across the country. The proposed settlement would help restore free market competition in rental markets for millions of American renters.
“Competing companies must make independent pricing decisions, and with the rise of algorithmic and artificial intelligence tools, we will remain at the forefront of vigorous antitrust enforcement,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division.
RealPage is a provider of commercial revenue management software and services for the conventional multifamily rental housing industry. As alleged in Plaintiffs’ complaint, RealPage’s revenue management software has relied on nonpublic, competitively sensitive information shared by landlords to set rental prices. RealPage’s software has also included features designed to limit rental price decreases and otherwise align pricing among competitors. In addition, RealPage has hosted meetings attended by competing property management companies where competitively sensitive information was shared.
If approved by the court, the proposed consent judgment would require RealPage to:
As required by the Tunney Act, the proposed settlement, along with a competitive impact statement, will be published in the Federal Register. Any interested person should submit written comments concerning the proposed settlement within 60 days following the publication to Danielle Hauck, Acting Chief, Technology and Digital Platforms Section, Antitrust Division, U.S. Department of Justice, 450 Fifth Street NW, Suite 7050, Washington, DC 20530.

Gears of WarLayoffsSplash DamageTransformers 
Longtime English studio Splash Damage is facing an uncertain future as it begins a consultation process that will affect all staff and likely lead to layoffs.
On November 26, Splash Damage publicly announced online that the studio was entering a “studio-wide consultation process” that would involve all employees across all roles and disciplines. This follows the London-based studio being acquired in September by a private equity investor after being sold by its previous owner, Chinese conglomerate Tencent.
“This was a difficult step for us to take,” said Splash Damage via a message shared on LinkedIn. “But we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We’re committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.”
Splash Damage already suffered layoffs earlier this year after the Transformers game it was working on was canceled. The last game the studio shipped was 2020’s Outcasters for Google’s now-defunct Stadia game streaming service. Before that, the studio, which was formed in 2001, had developed various popular multiplayer games, including Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Brink, and helped Xbox as a support studio on Halo and Gears of War titles. It also developed Gears of War Tactics.Â 
It is the latest round of bad news for the video game industry as developers continue to be laid off and studios closed as publishers tighten their belts and begin investing more into AI generation tools.

I expect several consequences of this, including:
1. Model collapse.  Training LLMs on the output of other LLMs has been shown to lower the model's quality, and it gets worse with each iteration.  So, the Internet has become less valuable as an LLM training data source, and this trend will continue, making it more difficult to train new models or improve existing ones.
2. Increased demand for guaranteed human-generated content.  This is both from competition between LLM training businesses who need original s 
This is why I'm interested in something like the 90s web directories. The idea of a human scoping out the worthwhile stuff, manually evaluating it for inclusion.
The web feels incredibly closed-off now, like a box. So much content lost in the black hole of social media. It used to feel like you were sailing out into the wide world to see what you could find. Now it's like some company has you in the lockup with some cellmates. They feed you slop 3 times a day, monitor your every breath, and never let you out

Who cares?  The concept is so last century that it is not relevant anymore.
New content is being produced faster than it can be consumed.  There is no longer a value to it.  The money is made by selling advertising views and by paid manipulation of the narrative.  Nobody needs to clone yesterdays work when they can just generate a new work to sell today.
While it's true that the value of content is driven down by the signal to noise ratio, AI being noise, the fact that AI can't be copyrighted is an important distinction. Only humans can copyright, a court-tested fact.
Does that fact increase the quality of content? No. What it does mean is that humans can monetize their works and eat; AI can make content and sell you ads or influence you to buy something.
This reduces to a question: Do you want to feed humans or the AI muck? The choice is yours. Some humans p

If you're in the business of running these SEO-trap blogs to make money, you need content. You used to have to hire a writer to generate content for you, or buy articles from wholesalers. Now you just generate them from thin air for a few cents. It's evolution at work, really... the content adapts to the algorithm. The real content is long gone.
At this point it's best to go straight to the source and use an LLM, it can synthesize exactly what you want instead of waiting for some blog syndicate to do it for you.

""Hello again, Peabody here...""

31,2025-11-26,"I'd definitely recommend Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) or Oakley Meta Vanguard, but if you're new to smart glasses, start on the first-gen ground floor.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Meta wants to clear out stock of its first-generation Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. It's launched Black Friday deals for its old Wayfarer models, with its G15 Green and Clear Wayfarers at $238 ($60 off) and its more popular Matte Black Wayfarers with Polarized Graphite lenses at $263 ($66 off). Meta glasses have never gotten a major sale in the 2+ years since launch, making this a rare opportunity.
In some ways, this deal is a trap. Meta just launched its Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses and Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, both of which I gave glowing reviews. I particularly loved how Meta improved battery life this generation, while the first-gen models have shorter battery life by comparison.
Here's the problem: the new Ray-Bans start at $379, or $409 with polarized lenses, while Vanguard launched at $499, and I don't expect either device to get a major discount until 2027, based on past history. If you're shopping for your first smart glasses, it makes much more sense to buy the first-gen glasses for less and see if you like them or not; they'll last you until Meta's third-generation glasses in a couple of years.
or: Wayfarer (Gen 1) Polarized Graphite: $329 $263.20 at Best Buy
Android Central verdict: ★★★★
The original Ray-Ban Meta glasses blew up in a way no one expected, selling millions of units on the strength of its high-res photography, open-ear audio, and Meta AI insights. You get a natural fit that blends in with other sunglasses, letting you capture shots organically by tapping a button or ask the AI for insights, all with your phone in your pocket.
Also at: Amazon | Meta
If you compare the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 vs. Gen 1, the difference isn't as stark as you'd assume. The photo resolution and FoV, storage space, IPX4 water resistance, mic and speaker quality, Wi-Fi/ Bluetooth connectivity, and apps are unchanged, while the weight is virtually the same.
The new glasses do give you a video resolution boost from 1080p to 3K and a couple of extra hours of battery life. But is it worth spending an extra $150 or so for the 2nd-gen polarized glasses, just to get these two perks?
 



Equally important, Meta has already brought its best second-generation features to its first-gen glasses, making them feel new. Vanguard glasses introduced Garmin integration in October, autocapturing videos at important race moments and reading out your health stats from your wrist; Meta brought this feature to Gen 1 glasses the next month.
Likewise, Vanguard glasses added improved video stabilization algorithms to make in-motion sporty videos look smoother, and Meta brought the feature to first-gen glasses in November without telling anyone. Meta isn't interested in gatekeeping its features to make you upgrade, which means you can buy the last-gen Ray-Ban deal without any FOMO.
The shorter battery life, you'll have to live with. But smart glasses fans lived with the 4-hour maximum for two years; you can too to get this Black Friday price! Or, if you can't, splurge on the full-price newer glasses without regrets!

Catalio Capital Management is adding to its team.
The $2.3 billion healthcare investor has hired Ajay Mantha as a partner within its hedge fund, Catalio Public Equities, according to a note to investors seen by Business Insider.
Mantha previously had been an executive at Zimmer Partners, a New York-based stockpicking hedge fund where Mantha built and then ran the healthcare group. He spent nine years in Bain Capital's public equities division as the head of its healthcare sector group. Prior to that, he worked as an analyst at D.E. Shaw and a consultant for McKinsey. 
The note states he will start next year and report to Ben Snedeker, the firm's head of public equities.
Catalio declined to comment on the hire.
The hedge fund, which now runs roughly $900 million following an infusion of capital from Brevan Howard, is up nearly 16% this year, a person close to the manager says, besting the average fund's gains of 9.9%.
The hedge fund has returned roughly 55% since rebranding with the Catalio name at the start of 2023, this person added.
The firm, founded by George Petrocheilos and Jacob Vogelstein, originally focused on private market investments in the healthcare and biotech sectors before acquiring longtime stockpicking hedge fund HealthCor Management at the end of 2022.
HealthCor, founded in 2005 by SAC Capital alums Art Cohen and Joe Healey, was merged into Catalio but is still led by Snedeker, who invested for HealthCor for four years before the sale of the fund.
Catalio counts plenty of big names as backers, including private equity giant KKR. Brevan gave the hedge fund $200 million in a separately managed account earlier this month, Reuters reported.
Wealthy financiers such as Thoma Bravo founder Orlando Bravo and Highbridge Capital founder Glenn Dubin are also investors in Catalio.

34,2025-11-26,"Michael Burry has doubled down on his critique of Nvidia and other AI giants, and revealed he's betting against both it and Palantir.
In a Tuesday post on his new Substack, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame called out Nvidia's recent memo to Wall Street analysts, saying it was responding to claims he didn't make.
Burry, in a post titled ""Unicorns and Cockroaches: Blessed Fraud,"" wrote that he couldn't believe Nvidia's responses had come from the world's most valuable public company. He said the document contained ""one straw man after another"" and the memo ""almost reads like a hoax.""
The market veteran, who recently closed his hedge fund to outside cash and turned his focus to writing, said he'd never suggested Nvidia was dragging out the depreciation of its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), as it's primarily a chip designer with minimal capital expenditures, not a manufacturer.
""No one cares about Nvidia's own depreciation,"" he said. ""One straw man burnt.""
Burry also dismissed Nvidia's argument that its older-generation chips are still being used, saying his concern is that newer chips could become functionally obsolete between 2026 and 2028.
""I am looking forward because I see problems that are relevant to investors today,"" he wrote. ""A second straw man burnt.""
Burry added that Nvidia's rebuttal to him was ""disingenuous on the face, and disappointing.""
He disclosed in his latest post that he's placed wagers against the chipmaker and another AI darling: ""I continue to own puts on Palantir and Nvidia, both of which will be discussed at another time.""
Nvidia and Palantir didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Burry's latest post.
One of Burry's chief concerns is AI companies' depreciation accounting, or how quickly they're projecting their assets will decline in value and how much they'll be worth at the end of their useful life.
Companies can increase their short-term profits and the stated value of their assets by spreading those costs over five or six years, rather than three. But that could pave the way for hefty writedowns in the future, Burry wrote on Substack.
He also highlighted a recent interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which Nadella said he had slowed the company's data center buildout earlier this year because he was wary of overbuilding infrastructure to serve one generation of AI chips, as the next generation will have different power and cooling requirements.
""The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes, as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in graphics chips with accelerating planned obsolescence,"" Burry wrote.
He hinted that between the memo and wider market reaction, his depreciation comments have sparked a bigger reaction than he anticipated: ""I have been drawn into something much bigger than me.""
Nvidia shares have slumped 14% from their November 3 high, as investors have grown more concerned that AI companies are overspending and overvalued.
Burry shot to fame after his massive bet against the US housing bubble was immortalized in the book and movie ""The Big Short."" Known for his dire warnings about crashes and recessions, he returned to X after a two-year break in late October, making the case that AI stocks are in a bubble.
Burry's Scion Asset Management previously revealed on November 3, the same day as Palantir's third-quarter earnings, that it held bearish put options on both companies at the end of September.
Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets ""batshit crazy"" in a televised interview the next day, prompting Burry to post on X that he wasn't surprised Karp ""couldn't crack a simple 13F.""
In a subsequent X post, Burry said the Palantir puts were ""done last month"" and he was ""on to much better things"" ahead of his Substack's launch.
The earlier positions had a combined notional value of $1.1 billion, but Burry wrote in his latest Substack post that they only cost him around $10 million each.
Burry hasn't shared the thinking behind his Palantir wagers. Shares of the AI-powered data analysis company hit a high ahead of its earnings but have since fallen 20%. They've still risen 26-fold since the start of 2023, valuing Palantir at around $390 billion — nearly 90 times its projected $4.4 billion of revenue this year.

38,2025-11-26,"Thai pork producers are bracing for intense competition as the US seeks duty-free access to a $3bn market.
By Vijitra Duangdee
Share
Save
Bangkok, Thailand – Stewed, seasoned with sugar and cloves, deep-fried or dished up in a zingy chilli mince – the diets of most Thais are incomplete without pork.
But a $3bn market – supplied nearly entirely by domestic pig farmers – may be about to face competition like never before from the giant hog farms of the world’s third-largest producer, the United States.
While the fine print of the Thai government’s preliminary trade deal with the US is yet to be revealed, some details have emerged.
Washington has a 10,000-item-long wish list of goods it wants to enter Thailand duty-free to reduce its $45.5bn trade deficit with the Southeast Asian country, an imbalance President Donald Trump says unfairly disadvantages US producers.
The list includes pork, corn, soya beans and some fruits.
Shortly after Trump met Thailand’s caretaker prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Malaysia last month, the White House revealed some of the many strings attached to its trade deal, which set the tariff rate for the kingdom’s exports to the US at 19 percent.
They include Thailand agreeing to “address and prevent barriers to US food and agricultural products in the Thai market”, according to the White House, and a commitment to “expediting access” for US meat and poultry products.
That has panicked Thailand’s pig farmers, who say the industry may not survive a flood of cheaper, subsidised US pork, which is fattened up on ractopamine, a livestock additive banned in many countries, including the kingdom.
If US pork is allowed into Thailand without duties, nothing less than the kingdom’s food security is at stake, according to Worawut Siripun, deputy secretary-general of the Swine Raisers Association of Thailand.
“Producers will not be able to survive and will stop raising pigs. But the risks are not only for farms facing falling pig prices,” Worawut, who has about 10,000 pigs, told Al Jazeera.
“Those who grow feed crops are also affected, as well as animal feed traders, animal feed producers, and veterinary drug sellers. Everyone in the production cycle is impacted.”
Trump had made trade talks with Thailand contingent on Bangkok signing an extended ceasefire agreement with Cambodia.
But in the weeks since meeting Anutin, Thailand has suspended truce talks over alleged Cambodian breaches of the terms of the agreement.
While there are conflicting signals over whether tensions with Cambodia have put Thailand’s trade negotiations with its biggest export destination on the back burner, farmers and livestock companies are bracing for intensified competition.
Thailand’s pork industry has weathered challenges ranging from outbreaks of swine flu to illegal imports from China and Vietnam.
But it faces high costs, largely as a result of government price controls on corn and soya used to feed pigs and other livestock – a measure intended to protect the country’s crop farmers, a key voting bloc.
And like most of Thailand’s agricultural producers, the country’s pig farmers deal with slim margins.
“Both imported and locally produced feed materials in Thailand are more expensive compared to the US, where feed is cheaper,” Worawut said.
Corn and other feed farmers are also bracing for tough times.
Thailand announced earlier this month that it would lift its annual corn import limit, from approximately 50,000 tonnes to 1 million tonnes, and scrap a 20 percent tariff to appease Washington.
Prime Minister Anutin is likely to dissolve parliament in the coming weeks and set a date for new elections.
He is angling to return to office in defiance of critics who say he has already given away too much to Washington before a comprehensive trade deal has been signed.
Trump officials have already announced a deal to gain preferential access to Thailand’s rare earths, the sale of billions of dollars of US-made aircraft and a promise by Bangkok not to tax US digital services companies.
Anutin’s bargaining position has been weakened by tough economic conditions.
On Monday, the Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council trimmed its economic growth forecast for 2026 to 1.2 percent, down from an expected 2 percent expansion this year – by far the weakest performance among Southeast Asia’s leading economies.
With a third round of trade talks with the US under a cloud following the suspension of the Thailand-Cambodia peace deal, the main political opposition party has called on the government to pause the negotiations and consult with local stakeholders.
“This is a crucial moment,” said Weerayut Karnchuchat, deputy leader of the opposition People’s Party, Thailand’s largest in parliament.
“The minister of commerce has said negotiations will conclude by the end of 2025. That leaves around two months. The government should hold eight weeks of stakeholder hearings … especially groups directly affected, such as corn farmers.”
Thailand should take stock and assess if regional peers with full US trade deals – including Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia – are happy with the outcomes and “whether Thailand is offering too much”, he added.
For many midsized businesses, the return of Trump and his trade war has made for a difficult year, with demand depressed across countless supply chains exposed to the US.
Orders are retreating inside Thailand for everything from lightbulbs to electrical wires needed to run factories that export to the US.
Tipok Lertwattanaweerakul, a durian farmer and middleman, said he has seen his profit margins slashed.
Saudi Arabian buyers who sold durian to customers in the US had been Lertwattanaweerakul’s main source of business, but with the Arab country hit with a 10 percent tariff, “they are no longer purchasing from me at all,” he told Al Jazeera.

Alibaba's CEO brushed off talk of an AI bubble and said he's doubling down on spending.
The CEO of the Chinese tech giant, Eddie Wu, said on Alibaba's second-quarter earnings call on Tuesday that the company ""doesn't really see much of an issue in terms of a so-called AI bubble.""
""We're not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand,"" Wu said, adding that the pace at which Alibaba can deploy new servers is insufficient.
""In the next three years to come, AI resources will continue to be under supply,"" he said.
Wu said that the surge in demand isn't coming from hype but from real-world AI adoption across the economy, such as across product development, manufacturing processes, and supporting companies.
He said that Alibaba's Qwen app, launched just last week, surpassed 10 million downloads in its first week.
On Tuesday, Alibaba Group posted 247.8 billion yuan, or $34.8 billion, in revenue for the quarter ending September 30, a 5% increase from last year.
Profits were hit by heavy spending on AI and commerce. Net income fell 53% from a year earlier to 20.6 billion yuan due to a ""decrease in income from operations."" Sales and marketing expenses surged, more than doubling from a year ago.
The cloud division, which includes Alibaba's Qwen platform, led the company's growth. The cloud business grew 34% to 39.8 billion yuan, driven by ""public cloud revenue growth, including the increasing adoption of AI-related products.""
Wu said on the call that the company is planning to invest ""aggressively"" in AI infrastructure to meet demand.
Alibaba announced in February that it would invest 380 billion yuan in AI infrastructure over the next three years.
""In big picture terms, I would say that the 380 billion figure we had mentioned previously might be on the small side,"" Wu said on Tuesday.
The company's stock is up more than 86% this year.
Wu's remarks contrast with those of Alibaba's chairman, Joe Tsai.
Tsai said at the HSBC Global Investment Summit in March that he's starting to ""see the beginning of some kind of bubble,"" pointing to the rush to build data centers.
Big Tech firms, including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, are collectively expected to spend $320 billion on capital expenditures this year as they race to expand their AI infrastructure.
The AI bubble debate has split tech leaders across the industry.
Some executives have rejected the idea that the AI boom is overheating. Last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang dismissed fears of an AI bubble on his company's latest earnings call.
""There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,"" Huang said. ""From our vantage point, we see something very different.""
Others have been more cautious. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in August that investor enthusiasm has run ahead of reality.
""Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes,"" he said.

Viwoods’ AiPaper Reader earned attention at launch as the first e-reader to run Android 16. In the spirit of Black Friday deals, it’s now a bit cheaper to give it a go. As long as you’re a Prime member, the device is currently available for $237, down from its launch price of $279.
The AiPaper Reader stands out because it behaves less like a traditional e-reader and more like a pocketable smart device. It runs Android 16, which helps it stand out from the crowd of e-readers using older software (or stuck in closed ecosystems). Unlike Kindles, for example, it supports full app installs. The device also includes 4GB of RAM paired with 128GB of storage, and there’s a 4G LTE SIM slot for staying connected away from Wi-Fi, though for data-only use.
For comfortable reading, the device uses a 6.13-inch E Ink Carta 1300 display at 300 ppi, keeping text crisp while minimizing eye strain. Viwoods also included a dedicated AI button on the side, which triggers access to tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek, adding a smart-assistant edge that helps it stand out in the e-reader crowd.
My favorite aspect of the device is its portability. It weighs about 138g and measures just 6.7mm thick, making it genuinely pocketable. For shoppers used to carrying a Kindle, it feels noticeably closer to phone dimensions. Unlike the similarly sized reMarkable Paper Pro Move, though, the AiPaper Reader doesn’t offer stylus support, and the lighting setup is more basic than what you’ll find on higher-end e-readers. Still, if your priority is flexibility, the AiPaper Reader offers plenty.
Simply put, Android 16 makes the AiPaper Reader stand out in a category that doesn’t always see modern software rollouts. If you’re an Amazon Prime member, the current 15% discount makes it an even more appealing option.

It’s that time of year again when families gather to feast on bountiful harvests and to give thanks for all of our blessings.

This year, skip the “Vibes” and instead focus on market data. Don’t lose sight of nuances and shades of grey; they don’t make for great memes, but they do lead to a better understanding of what’s going on.
Here are ten nuanced, slightly contrarian ideas for you to chew over:
1. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: Perhaps we are in the late stages of an AI-driven bubble; we could just as easily be in a once-in-a-generation transformational technology boom that will drive both the economy and the stock market higher for years to come.
Too many people fail to recognize how challenging it is to identify these generational market turning points in real time.
My favorite takes on AI have come from Derek Thompson and Timothy Lee, who looked into the 12 main arguments Pro & Con, and Benjamin Riley, who aims to “help people understand human cognition and artificial intelligence.”
2. INFLATION: Everything costs more this year — except for the Turkey.
The largest fiscal stimulus since World War 2 led to the largest inflation surge since the 1970s. The rate of price increases rose by 9% (peaking June 2022) before falling back to 3% nearly as quickly. There were numerous causes of inflation, but the top of the list was the pandemic supply issues and the huge fiscal stimulus.
People confuse the rate of price change with prices. We had high inflation; today, we have low(ish) inflation, but we still retain higher prices. Everything is much more expensive today, even with inflation way down. Low Inflation and High Prices are not mutually exclusive.
CPI Inflation is in the 2-3% range today, but it is ticking upwards, creating difficulties for those on the FOMC who want to cut rates.

3. SUPPLY & DEMAND: We may not have structural inflation as we did in the 1970s, but we do have a structural imbalance in supply and demand of many critical goods and services.
A few significant examples:
Until supply catches up with demand, those prices will remain high. And that is before we get to health care and education costs.

4. ENERGY: The inflation of the 1970s was structural, caused in large part by the Arab Oil Embargo. In contrast, the United States is a net energy exporter today. In the 1970s, energy accounted for about 10% of the average household budget; the Chicago Fed found it peaked at nearly 14% in the early 1980s.
Household energy costs are about half of those levels today (5-6%), even as energy consumption has increased significantly. Every power-hungry device, from automobiles to HVAC systems to appliances, is now many times more efficient than in the past.
The wildcard is increased demand from power-hungry data centers…
5. CRYPTO CRASH: Given the embrace of crypto by the President (and POTUS’s family), much of Bitcoin 2025 gains can be attributed to this administration’s policies. We should not be surprised by the correlation between the President’s political fortunes / approval ratings, and the price of Bitcoin.
The President has had a terrible month; from the election thumping to the fallout with MTG to losing multiple legal cases (Tariffs at SCOTUS, Comey / James case dismissals), it’s no surprise that Bitcoin has suffered a 30% crash this month as well:

6. TARIFFS: Are fascinating: They cause temporary inflation spikes and permanent higher prices. There is no getting around it – any additional tax on imported goods is a source of increased prices. And as we have seen before, even domestic producers will raise prices (Greedflation) if they believe consumers won’t balk.
The good news: If the Supreme Court arguments were anything to go on, many of the Tariffs are likely to get struck down.

7. RATE CUTS: You can make a solid case either way – inflation remains stubborn at (or over) 3%, but there are signs of labor market softness, slowing consumer sales, and mediocre sentiment.
Expectations had fallen to a ~20% chance of a rate cut – until yesterday’s poor data. Now, we are back to an 80% chance of a December cut. Beyond that is anyone’s guess…

8. BUBBLES: By definition, it takes a crowd to create a bubble. Can you recall the public, the media, or even the Fed identifying a bubble on a timely basis? (Me neither).
Asked differently, can investors rationally believe that prices are not entirely irrational? If your answer is yes, then it’s likely not a bubble.
Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the AI bubble debate is Alphabet (GOOGL) passing Nvidia (NVDA) YTD returns:
: 
9. RECESSION: People hate inflation, but the alternative was a deep and long-lasting pandemic recession. We avoided a 10-12% unemployment rate, but the cost was 9% inflation.
Consider the alternative, had both the Trump and Biden admins not cranked up the fiscal spend, people would have been furious at the failure to do anything1. It’s a Lose/Lose; whatever choice got made, half the population would have been furious.
As angry as people are over high prices, they would have been even angrier at a do-nothing government letting an ugly recession take hold.
10. VALUATIONS: The Mag 7 remains pricey, even as Nvidia slides 13% off its highs. Its expensive, but it also generates $57 billion in quarterly revenues! Some sectors are extremely overpriced, others are more reasonable. The S&P 493 — S&P 500 minus the Magnificent 7 — is at 20.7 P/E. Pricey, but not ridiculous.
Nuance is your friend.
Safe travels!

Spotify is reportedly planning another price hike, and this time it may pinch U.S. subscribers. According to a recent report by the Financial Times (as spotted by 9to5 Google), there has been some chatter that the streaming platform may increase prices for U.S. customers early next year.
Spotify increased its prices for subscribers in the U.S. back in 2024, when the cost of the every tier went up significantly, the Family plan experienced the largest jump, rising by $3 to reach $19.99 per month, while the Duo plan increased by $2 to and Individual plan went up to $11.99. Amidst these widespread increases, the Student plan was the only option to remain unchanged, holding steady at $5.99.
 



But if these rumors are indeed true, then it would mean U.S. users are facing their third price increase in less than three years (July 2023, July 2024, and potentially Q1 2026).
And while we don't know for sure how much each specific plan will see an increase, if Spotify follows its similar pattern from the previous years, then the multi-user plans may see a higher price point when compared to individual plans. Considering that these plans involve multiple people, cancelling the subscription is more of a hassle as it affects the entire household.
Reports suggest that Spotify is being pressurized by major music labels (Universal, Sony, Warner) to raise prices. These labels feel that music subscriptions are capped at a lower cost compared to video services like Netflix or Disney Plus, which have raised prices multiple times recently.
This potential price increase could also be linked to the renewal of Spotify's licensing deals with these labels. New agreements are expected to include clauses that would result in higher royalty payments, costs that Spotify may pass on to its subscribers.
 



Furthermore, this could benefit Spotify's financial standing as well. Analysts estimate that a mere $1 per month increase for U.S. subscribers alone could generate approximately $500 million in additional annual revenue, leading to consistent profit margins for investors.

Given that Spotify has already implemented price increases across the UK, Switzerland, Australia, and emerging markets throughout 2025, a similar hike in their largest subscriber market appears imminent.

43,2025-11-26,"Something weird is happening at Samsung's Black Friday sale.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Black Friday Samsung deals are here in full force, but while most shoppers are focused on the big sales over at Amazon and Best Buy, one of the best offers I've seen so far just dropped from an unlikely source: Samsung itself. Pick up the Galaxy Z Flip 7 (256GB version) before the Black Friday sale comes to an end and you'll be eligible for up to $600 off with trade-in OR a straight $300 off if you skip the trade-in process altogether.
For a little context, Amazon's Black Friday sale is offering $200 off the top-rated flip phone, which means Samsung is selling the phone for a full $100 less. As if that wasn't enough, Samsung's Black Friday deal is sweetening the deal by giving you access to some additional bundle discounts (such as 52% off the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro), six months of Google AI Pro, a six-month subscription to SiriusXM streaming, and more. It's not often that Amazon's pricing gets clobbered by the competition, so this win from Samsung is quite the welcome sight.
Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 256GB: $1,099.99 From $499.99 with trade-in | $799.99 without at Samsung
Head to Samsung during the site's big Black Friday sale and you'll be eligible for up to $600 off the Galaxy Z Flip 7 when you trade in an old or broken phone. Skip the trade-in process altogether and you'll still get $200 off, which is a record-smashing discount for the popular foldable. Buying from Samsung also gets you access to exclusive color variants that you won't find anywhere else!
Price check 💲: Amazon - $889.99 | Best Buy - $899.99
Note from the Editor: it appears that some customers are seeing a $200 no trade-in discount at Samsung, while others are seeing the $300 off that I'm describing here. I'm not sure what factors are affecting the discount, so I'd definitely try refreshing the page a few times if you aren't seeing the correct amount at first. Is this a bug on Samsung's part? Who knows, but I'd definitely jump on that $300 discount if you see it.
✅Recommended if: you want to score a historic discount on an eye-catching clamshell smartphone with powerful performance, a nearly-creaseless build, and all of the latest AI features.
❌Skip this deal if: you don't care about flip phones; you'd rather buy the device through your wireless carrier; you can get a better deal on our number-one favorite flip phone, the Motorola Razr Ultra.
Putting it simply, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is pure luxury, boasting an ultra-lightweight build, two AMOLED displays, and a nearly-invisible folding hinge. Under the hood you get the Samsung Exynos 2500 with 12GB of RAM, plus an upgraded 4,300mAh battery, seven years of OS and security upgrades, and all of the latest AI-boosted software features.
If I had to nitpick, it is worth mentioning that the Z Flip 7 didn't receive any significant camera upgrades over its predecessor, charging is relatively sluggish, and the Motorola Razr Ultra might offer the better experience if all you care about is using the world's absolute best flip phone.
Still, going with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is hardly a sacrifice, as the device offers one of the best foldable phones experiences on the market, and the ultra-lightweight build is simply unmatched in this space. Throw on an epic Black Friday discount and I can say with confidence that there's never been a better time to buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7. Why wait?

LLMs are collapsing borders in search, turning thin or misaligned regional content into global defaults that distort market visibility.
AI search isn’t just changing what content ranks; it’s quietly redrawing where your brand appears to belong. As large language models (LLMs) synthesize results across languages and markets, they blur the boundaries that once kept content localized. Traditional geographic signals of hreflang, ccTLDs, and regional schema are being bypassed, misread, or overwritten by global defaults. The result: your English site becomes the “truth” for all markets, while your local teams wonder why their traffic and conversions are vanishing.
This article focuses primarily on search-grounded AI systems such as Google’s AI Overviews and Bing’s generative search, where the problem of geo-identification drift is most visible. Purely conversational AI may behave differently, but the core issue remains: when authority signals and training data skew global and geographic context, synthesis often loses that context.
In classic search, location was explicit:
AI search breaks this deterministic system.
In a recent article on “AI Translation Gaps,” International SEO Blas Giffuni demonstrated this problem when he typed the phrase “proveedores de químicos industriales.” Rather than presenting the local market website with a list of industrial chemical suppliers in Mexico, it presented a translated list from the US, of which some either did not do business in Mexico or did not meet local safety or business requirements. A generative engine doesn’t just retrieve documents; it synthesizes an answer using whatever language or source it finds most complete.
If your local pages are thin, inconsistently marked up, or overshadowed by global English content, the model will simply pull from the worldwide corpus and rewrite the answer in Spanish or French.
On the surface, it looks localized. Underneath, it’s English data wearing a different flag.
AI systems treat language as a proxy for geography. A Spanish query could represent Mexico, Colombia, or Spain. If your signals don’t specify which markets you serve through schema, hreflang, and local citations, the model lumps them together.
When that happens, your strongest instance wins. And nine times out of 10, that’s your main English language website.
During training, LLMs learn from corpus distributions that heavily favor English content. When related entities appear across markets (‘GlobalChem Mexico,’ ‘GlobalChem Japan’), the model’s representations are dominated by whichever instance has the most training examples, typically the English global brand. This creates an authority imbalance that persists during inference, causing the model to default to global content even for market-specific queries.
Search engines naturally try to consolidate near-identical pages, and hreflang exists to counter that bias by telling them that similar versions are valid alternatives for different markets. When AI systems retrieve from these consolidated indexes, they inherit this hierarchy, treating the canonical version as the primary source of truth. Without explicit geographic signals in the content itself, regional pages become invisible to the synthesis layer, even when they are adequately tagged with hreflang.
This amplifies market-aggregation bias; your regional pages aren’t just overshadowed, they’re conceptually absorbed into the parent entity.
As LLMs incorporate more diverse training data, some geographic imbalances may diminish. However, structural issues like canonical consolidation and the network effects of English-language authority will persist. Even with perfect training data distribution, your brand’s internal hierarchy and content depth differences across markets will continue to influence which version dominates in synthesis.
Procurement teams in Mexico or Japan receive AI-generated answers derived from English pages. The contact info, certifications, and shipping policies are wrong, even if localized pages exist.
Even strong local competitors are being displaced because models weigh the English/global corpus more heavily. The result: the local authority doesn’t register.
Users perceive this as neglect:
“They don’t serve our market.”
“Their information isn’t relevant here.”
In regulated or B2B industries where compliance, units, and standards matter, this results in lost revenue and reputational risk.
Hreflang was a precision instrument in a rules-based world. It told Google which page to serve in which market. But AI engines don’t “serve pages” – they generate responses.
That means:
In short, hreflang still helps Google indexing, but it no longer governs interpretation.
AI systems learn from patterns of connectivity, authority, and relevance. If your global content has richer interlinking, higher engagement, and more external citations, it will always dominate the synthesis layer – regardless of hreflang.
Read more: Ask An SEO: What Are The Most Common Hreflang Mistakes & How Do I Audit Them?
Let’s look at a real-world pattern observed across markets:
Each of these steps seems minor, but together they create a digital sovereignty problem – global data has overwritten your local market’s representation.
In the era of generative search, the challenge isn’t just to rank in each market – it’s to make your presence geo-legible to machines.
Geo-legibility builds on international SEO fundamentals but addresses a new challenge: making geographic boundaries interpretable during AI synthesis, not just during traditional retrieval and ranking. While hreflang tells Google which page to index for which market, geo-legibility ensures the content itself contains explicit, machine-readable signals that survive the transition from structured index to generative response.
That means encoding geography, compliance, and market boundaries in ways LLMs can understand during both indexing and synthesis.
Note: While current evidence for schema’s direct impact on AI synthesis is limited, these properties strengthen traditional search signals and position content for future AI systems that may parse structured data more systematically.
Geo-legibility isn’t about speaking the right language; it’s about being understood in the right place.
Executives need to see this for what it is: not an SEO bug, but a strategic governance gap.
AI search collapses boundaries between brand, market, and language. Without deliberate reinforcement, your local entities become shadows inside global knowledge graphs.
That loss of differentiation affects:
Equity: Your local authority and link capital are absorbed by the global brand, distorting measurement and accountability.
The implications of AI-driven geo drift extend far beyond marketing. When your brand’s digital footprint no longer aligns with its operational reality, it creates measurable business risk. A misrouted customer in the wrong market isn’t just a lost lead; it’s a symptom of organizational misalignment between marketing, IT, compliance, and regional leadership.
Executives must ensure their digital infrastructure reflects how the company actually operates, which markets it serves, which standards it adheres to, and which entities own accountability for performance. Aligning these systems is not optional; it’s the only way to minimize negative impact as AI platforms redefine how brands are recognized, attributed, and trusted globally.
AI didn’t make geography irrelevant; it just exposed how fragile our digital maps were.
Hreflang, ccTLDs, and translation workflows gave companies the illusion of control.
AI search removed the guardrails, and now the strongest signals win – regardless of borders.
The next evolution of international SEO isn’t about tagging and translating more pages. It’s about governing your digital borders and making sure every market you serve remains visible, distinct, and correctly represented in the age of synthesis.
Because when AI redraws the map, the brands that stay findable aren’t the ones that translate best; they’re the ones who define where they belong.

Spend way too much time obsessing over headphones? Welcome to the club. Audiophiles all want the same thing: Clean sound, zero nonsense, and a pair of headphones that don't fall apart after a few months. But the problem is, many companies claim its headphones are the perfect ""studio-grade"" setup, yet only a handful meet those expectations. So, in our quest to find the best gadgets that belong in every audiophile's home, an expert's opinion was needed, and who's better than Consumer Reports when it comes to that? We went through its list of best headphones and picked out 13 models that stand out for consistency across the board. 
Some of these prioritize open-back clarity, others go all-in on noise cancellation, and a few try to balance both worlds without costing a month's rent. If price is a major concern, you can look at other top-rated headphones for less than $100, though we cannot guarantee they will be as good as the models on this list. While we won't be disclosing the specific Consumer Reports rating these headphones received, we will go into detail about why they stand out among the sea of options. 
If you're someone who cares deeply about how every note feels through your headphones, the Grado RS2x is very much built for you. It is priced at $550 and uses 44 mm fourth-generation X‑series dynamic drivers inside a bi‑wood housing made of maple and hemp for a warm and organic build. It is open-air, meaning there's barely any noise cancellation, with a nominal impedance of 38 ohms, a frequency response from 14 Hz to 28 kHz, and a super‑annealed 8-conductor copper cable to handle detailed signals. Moreover, the drivers are matched within 0.05 dB for consistency.
The wooden cups don't just look nice, they add subtle tonal richness, which helps vocals feel full and present. In addition to that, after the break-in period — which constitutes the initial 50 hours or so — the RS2x opens up even more, with the sound becoming more honest, deeper, and smoother. Because these are open-back, don't expect much isolation, but that's a trade-off for clarity and soundstage, something many audiophiles crave.
According to Consumer Reports, the RS2x performed very strongly in sound quality, with excellent owner satisfaction and brand reliability, giving it the best overall score on this list. Consumer Reports noted its sound presentation to be spacious with a grainy feel, and also highlighted that the pads can become a bit warm during very long sessions.
For over-ear headphones that feel like premium gear, the original Apple AirPods Max absolutely deliver. They use Apple-designed dynamic drivers, with support for active noise cancellation (ANC), transparency mode, and personalized spatial audio. Each ear cup includes an Apple H1 chip, and there are nine microphones in total, eight of which are for noise cancellation, with three of these tuned for voice pick-up. Recorded weight is about 385 grams, and Apple rates them for up to 20 hours of listening time with noise cancellation or spatial audio active.
The great thing about these H1 chips is that they deliver seamless integration with Apple devices, and the ANC is praised for being very effective without making music feel boxed in. While the weight can be an issue for some users, others like the premium feel — though it does come with a premium price tag of $549 as well.
Per Consumer Reports, this version of the Apple AirPods Max scored among the top-rated noise-cancelling headphones, with strong sound quality and excellent noise cancellation alongside great brand reliability and owner satisfaction. Due to the size and build quality, these Apple headphones also stand out for not feeling as fragile as some others on this list.
Those seeking wireless over-ear headphones that not only feel premium but are also reasonably priced, will find that the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e hits the ideal middle ground. It is priced at $399 and uses 40 mm dynamic drivers, supports Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive, aptX HD, AAC, and SBC, has hybrid active noise cancellation, a USB-C port for charging and audio, and a 30-hour battery life with a 15-minute quick charge feature that provides seven hours of use.
The S2e delivers a solid, balanced experience, and the digital signal processing (or DSP) tuning gives a detailed and spacious sound over older models. It comes in the form of more depth with a wider spread, especially for voices and instruments. On top of that, the long battery life makes it very usable for full work days or travel, and the USB-C wired option means you're not stuck with just Bluetooth.
In Consumer Reports' testing, the S2e scored very highly within its category, almost on par with the Apple AirPods Max. However, it scored slightly better than the competition when it came to brand reliability and owner satisfaction. These Bowers & Wilkins headphones are also known for providing effective ANC performance with strong long-term reliability.
Anyone in the market for lightweight, open-back headphones that give you that classic Grado energy without breaking the bank, should know that the Grado SR80x is a favorite for a reason. It is priced at just $125 and uses 44 mm dynamic drivers in an open-air design, has a 38-ohm impedance, a frequency response from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, and drivers that are matched within 0.1 dB.
For being the least expensive option on this list, the SR80x could be considered one of the best headphones you can buy. For those unaware, SR80 was the first ever Grado headphone, and this iteration is a sort of culmination of everything that makes Grado a great company. SR80x leans toward the treble and can feel quite bright, which allows attacks and spatial element details to really shine. Similar to other open-air headphones, you really only want the SR80x if you don't care about noise-cancellation and have a quiet listening spot.
Consumer Reports has the SR80x in a very strong position for its category, thanks to top-notch sound quality alongside some of the best brand reliability and owner satisfaction. In its review, Consumer Reports considered it to be great overall, with only very minor issues.
If you were hoping for a modern AirPods Max refresh, the USB-C AirPods Max brings the same signature Apple over-ear experience, but swaps the Lightning port for USB-C at the identical price tag of $549. It retains the Apple-designed driver, H1 chips, active noise cancellation, transparency mode, and spatial audio. Battery life also remains the same, with Apple claiming up to 20 hours with ANC or spatial audio.
In day-to-day use, the USB-C connector matters more than you might think, especially for owners who already have USB-C cables or want lossless wired playback – now supported after a software update. While the form factor and sound are very similar to the original, the port flexibility is a big win.
Similar to the Lightning variant, Consumer Reports gave this USB-C model a very favorable evaluation. Since it has nearly identical features to the original, the sound quality and everything else on these refreshed AirPods Max headphones are basically the same, with the only difference coming down to your port preferences.
Sonos Ace offers a premium and practical dynamic, making it a well-rounded option for audiophiles at a cost of $399. It has 40 mm drivers, up to 30 hours of battery life with active noise cancellation turned on, USB-C for charging, and Bluetooth 5.4 support.
The combination of these features and Sonos' build quality turns these headphones into a very versatile pair. The drivers deliver rich and balanced sound with clear mids without being overly bright, and the battery life means you can rely on it for long listening sessions or travel — plus they're known for being comfortable over long wear periods. The head-tracking and TV audio swap features make it especially useful if you already own a Sonos soundbar.
While Consumer Reports has not given Sonos Ace a rating on owner satisfaction and brand reliability, the sound quality and noise cancellation abilities earned it a very good overall score, only slightly behind Bowers & Wilkins. Consumer Reports noted its sound profile to be ""...somewhat bassy and a bit grainy and hazy.""
Are you curious about Grado's Prestige series of headphones? Well then, the Grado SR225x might be your sweet spot. These come with a price tag of $225 and feature 44 mm 4th-gen X Series drivers similar to other Grado entries on this list, with an open-air housing, 38-ohm impedance, and F-series foam cushions.
These specs, combined with the F cushions, help broaden its textured tone, making the mids more expressive and detailed while keeping the lows punchy and well-balanced overall. Users have compared it to other entries from Grado, such as the SR80x, and claim that the SR225x adds more clarity, a bit more bass, and a more spacious feeling to the music. The open-air design means little to no isolation, but the payoff is in how you hear instruments separate from one another.
Consumer Reports has given the SR225x a very high overall score, on par with SR80x, making the choice come down to nuanced preferences and price. It excels in sound quality and has great owner satisfaction and brand reliability. Consumer Reports noted that SR225x has a lively and bassy sound that does a good job of retaining room ambience.
For those whose main focus is the core B&W Px7 sound but without the evolved DSP, the Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2 model offers a very familiar experience. It comes with a price tag of $208.50 and has 40 mm drivers, Bluetooth 5.2 with aptX Adaptive, aptX HD, AAC, and SBC, USB-C for charging, and a 30-hour battery life with fast charging, giving you about seven hours of use from just a 15-minute top-up. The specs are very similar to the S2e variant.
The Px7 S2 has a character that's both refined and dynamic, helping it outperform some of the best headphones on the market. It leans toward clarity and a focused sound, with a very impressive, taut bass. The USB-C port gives you the option to plug in for higher-fidelity streaming, and the ANC is solid without completely flattening the music.
Consumer Reports found the Px7 S2 to be a dependable model, with particularly good scores for sound quality and owner satisfaction. It also features excellent brand reliability and the noise cancellation capabilities are noteworthy.
If you want a premium option that delivers Bose's signature quality, then the $429 Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones might just be the thing. They use a single dynamic driver per ear and support adaptive noise cancellation and Bluetooth 5.3. A recent upgrade brings up to 30 hours of battery life with ANC on, and 45 hours without. These Bose units charge via USB-C, and the quick charge function delivers 2.5 hours of extended time in about 15 minutes.
The battery life is long enough for a few days' work, and better than most in the market. The new ""Immersive Audio"" mode makes music feel more three-dimensional, giving an experience closer to spatial listening at the expense of a few hours of battery life. Consumer Reports rated the Ultra highly for its noise cancellation and owner satisfaction, which is the highest of any on this list. It also has excellent brand reliability and great sound quality.
The Grado SR325x offers a refined and precise listening experience, making it a strong contender among our lineup of best headphones for audiophiles. It is no surprise that this company has taken so many spots here, as it delivers some of the best open-air headphones on the market. The SR325x is priced at $295 and also comes with the signature 44 mm 4th-gen X Series drivers, a brushed aluminum housing with an open-air design, a frequency response between 18 Hz and 24 kHz, and 38-ohm impedance.
Those specs make the detail clearer, and the metal housing helps reduce unwanted resonance. The SR325x has been praised for its soundstage and resolution, with reviewers noting its excellent dynamics and entertaining performance. That said, these headphones are best suited for just a few hours of use at a time and may get slightly uncomfortable over long sessions.
Consumer Reports notes that the SR325x has excellent sound quality and owner satisfaction. The brand reliability is the same across all Grado entries on this list, giving the SR325x an overall score only slightly behind the RS2x. 
Bang & Olufsen Beoplay HX brings style to the headphones table without sacrificing features designed for audiophiles. It uses custom 40 mm electro-dynamic drivers with Neodymium magnets and features adaptive digital noise cancellation, transparency mode, and Bluetooth 5.1 connectivity. It supports USB-C charging and offers up to 35 hours of playback with ANC on, or up to 40 hours with just Bluetooth. The frequency range is between 20 Hz and 22 kHz.
The 40 mm drivers deliver detailed mids, and the noise cancellation is more adaptive than fixed — meaning it adjusts intelligently depending on your environment. The battery life on these B&O headphones has been praised by experts, who note it easily outlasts many competing active noise-cancellation headphones. As well, the aluminum finish and premium materials make them feel more like a luxury accessory than a utility item.
In Consumer Reports testing, the HX scored highly across the board, though owner satisfaction is on the lower end, which could be due to the $749 price tag. These are premium headphones, and they feel exactly like that — whether you find the features worth the money is an entirely personal decision.
Dyson OnTrac is another well-rounded headphone option with a price tag of $499. It uses 40 mm Neodymium drivers for sound, supports up to 40 dB of noise cancellation with eight built-in mics, offers a frequency response from 6 Hz to 21 kHz, and gives you up to 55 hours of battery life on a USB-C charge. And before you point it out, yes, the battery life is among the best you'll find anywhere. These headphones are built for endurance with 10-minute quick-charge capability, which gives up to 2.5 hours of listening time. 
Moreover, the Dyson application lets you tweak equalizer settings, and audiophile-friendly Android apps like these are helpful since the default tuning leans toward clarity and neutrality. Experts have compared the weight of these Dyson units to that of the AirPods Max, making them not ideal for very long listening sessions. Consumer Reports has yet to rate the OnTrac for brand reliability and owner satisfaction, but its sound quality and noise cancellation capability alone translate to a favorable overall score.
Similar to the Ultra model, the Bose QuietComfort Wireless headphones use a dynamic driver design for each side, support Bluetooth 5.2, and have USB-C for fast charging. A full charge on these headphones gives you up to 24 hours of listening time, and a 15-minute quick charge provides about four hours of playback. Ultimately, these are inferior versions of Ultra as the latter is the more premium iteration with advanced features, so as expected, the Wireless variant comes with a lower price tag of $359.
Though wireless, there is a wired option, which means you can keep listening even if the battery hits zero. These Bose headphones have been praised for versatility, especially with the USB-C charging convenience and long battery life, making them easy to rely on for long trips. The customizable equalizer, controlled via the Bose Music app, lets you tweak the sound to your liking, whether you want more bass or clearer highs. 
According to Consumer Reports', the QuietComfort Wireless excelled in owner satisfaction, noise cancellation and brand reliability, with good remarks on sound quality. While these Bose units may not be the most audiophile-leaning headphones in terms of ultra-high fidelity, the balance of performance and usability makes it an excellent pick.
We examined Consumer Reports' testing of each headphone and highlighted only those with the highest overall score. This rating is given by Consumer Reports on the basis of several criteria: Sound quality, owner satisfaction, and reliability, with the addition of noise cancellation for headphones that are not open-back. Since the list is not ranked, the order in which they appear does not determine the capability of one over another.
Expert opinion or general user consensus on a product was not used to evaluate the headphones, as the evaluation focused solely on Consumer Reports data. However, it was used to give more details about the products and provide more information for the reader. If you are looking to purchase a new pair for yourself, it could be the right time, as some of these headphones are on sale at up to 50% off. And if your goal is to turn your home into a haven for listening to music, there are a dozen major Bluetooth speaker brands you can direct your attention to."
47,2025-11-26,"Stock markets rallied over 1.2 percent Wednesday, buoyed by expectations of interest rate cuts in the US and India, a decline in crude oil prices and supportive movements in the rupee amid reports of an imminent trade deal with the US. The benchmark Sensex surged more than 1,000 points or 1.2 percent to cross 85,000 and closed at 85,609, while the NSE Nifty climbed past 26,000 to close at 26,205 in euphoric activity.
The Sensex appears poised to set a new record high in the coming days. It had previously logged a closing high of 85,836 on September 26, 2024, and an intra-day peak of 85,978 on September 27, 2024.
Almost all sectoral indices gained ground, with metals rising over two percent, the bank index by 1.18 percent, IT by 1.45 percent and energy by 1.66 percent. Optimism was fuelled by growing expectations of a December Federal Reserve rate cut after softer US retail data, weaker consumer confidence and supportive comments from Fed policymakers.
An important factor that supported Indian market sentiment has been the sharp decline in Brent crude prices, as a lower outflow on account of oil imports will help keep the current account deficit under check.
Crude oil prices tumbled last week, falling to a one-month low as expectations of a Russia-Ukraine peace agreement gained momentum. US President Donald Trump reportedly drafted a peace framework and issued an ultimatum to the Ukrainian president to respond by November 27, raising hopes of easing sanctions and increased Russian oil supply to global markets.
“A stronger dollar index further pressured crude prices. However, China’s planned stimulus for its housing sector and improved US consumer sentiment could offer support at lower levels,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities.
On Wednesday, Brent was trading under USD 62 per barrel against USD 65 per barrel three weeks ago, with global research houses projecting a further decline, which could be hugely beneficial to the Indian economy. A recent report published by JP Morgan projected that the supply glut could keep prices under check and could even fall to USD 30 per barrel by end of 2027.
India imports around 85 percent of its oil requirement. The share of oil imports in India’s total import bill is more than 25 percent. A dip in oil prices benefits the current account deficit, which is the difference between the values of goods and services imported and exported.
A decline in crude prices also helps in keeping inflation under control. Crude oil-related products have a share of more than 9 percent in the WPI basket, and therefore, a 10 percent decline in crude prices may lead to a 0.9 percent dip in WPI inflation. A dip in crude oil prices also leads to a reduction in the subsidy on LPG and kerosene, easing the government’s subsidy bill.
Export-oriented companies and infotech firms are set to gain from the recent decline in crude oil prices.
Another factor that boosted the markets is the possibility of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve next month.
New York Fed President and FOMC Vice Chair John Williams said the labour market is cooling and inflation risks have eased, shifting the balance in favour of a rate cut. “My assessment is that downside risks to employment have increased, while upside risks to inflation have lessened somewhat,” he said. “Therefore, I still see room for a further adjustment in the near term to bring the federal funds rate closer to neutral.”
The Fed is guided by two mandates — maximising employment and keeping inflation in check. Until Friday, both appeared broadly balanced, pointing to a status quo in December. That equation has now changed. A US rate cut would likely boost foreign portfolio inflows into India and other emerging markets.
Goldman Sachs Research expects policymakers to lower their target rate again this year. “While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,” David Mericle, chief US economist, writes in the team’s report, after a speech by US Fed chief Jerome Powell.
Markets are expecting a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India early next month as India’s retail inflation dropped to a historic low of 0.25 percent in October, marking the lowest level since the Consumer Price Index (CPI) series was introduced. If rates are cut, credit demand is likely to accelerate further, as lower borrowing costs make loans more attractive for both companies and consumers. This, in turn, can spur fresh capital expenditure, encourage businesses to expand capacity, and support a broader pickup in new investments across the economy.
On November 24, RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said the current economic indicators suggest there is scope for a repo rate cut, but a decision on it will be made by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). His statement comes days ahead of the MPC’s upcoming meeting scheduled from December 3 to 5.
“At the October meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), it was indicated that there is a scope for a further rate cut in the (monetary) policy. None of the macro indicators, including inflation, released after that (post October MPC meeting), suggest that the scope (for rate cut) has reduced. So, there is definitely a scope (for a rate cut), but MPC will decide on it in the upcoming meeting,” Malhotra said in an interview.
During the current easing cycle, the MPC has reduced the repo rate by 100 basis points (bps) between February and June 2025. After keeping the repo rate steady at 5.5 percent in the August and October policy, economists expect the MPC to reduce the repo rate by 25 bps in December.
  
MEA spokesperson rejects Pakistan's criticism of PM Modi's Ayodhya Ram Temple flag-hoisting, calling it a significant moment. Jaiswal said the statement shows Pakistan's ""deeply stained record of bigotry"" and urges them to address their own human rights issues instead of lecturing others."

Samsung earned its reputation as the most reliable brand for SSDs through years of consistent performance and the T7 has been an iconic model in portable storage since its launch a few years back. Traditional external hard drives (HDD) feel painfully slow once you experience the speed difference that solid-state technology delivers, and even more as this T7 model just hit a record low at $168 instead of the usual $187 (and $399 at launch!) for Black Friday on Amazon.
Most color options already sold out completely which leaves only the gray version in stock so you’ll need to move fast if you want one before inventory disappears entirely. This drive transfers files at speeds up to 1,050MB/s which means copying a full 4K movie takes under a minute instead of the 5+ minutes you’d spend waiting with an old spinning hard drive.
See at Amazon
The USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface pushes read speeds to 1,050MB/s and write speeds close behind, which gives you transfer rates that actually match modern file sizes and project demands. You can edit 4K video directly from the drive without pre-copying footage to your computer’s internal storage, saving time and preserving precious laptop SSD space for applications and system files. With a total capacity of 2TB, you’ll have room for approximately 500,000 photos, 50 hours of 4K video, or your entire game library plus room for new titles.
Measuring smaller than a credit card and weighing only 58 grams, the compact design disappears into any bag pocket without adding noticeable bulk or weight to your carry. The metal construction provides shock resistance that protects your data against drops from as high as 2 meters-though you obviously shouldn’t test that limit on purpose, just because the specs say it can handle it.
Efficient thermal management keeps the drive cool during extended file transfers, preventing performance throttling when you’re moving massive amounts of data for longer periods. Password protection and AES 256-bit hardware encryption secure your files in case the drive gets lost or stolen, providing peace of mind that your client projects or personal photos will not end up in random hands.
Cross-platform compatibility works seamlessly across Windows, Mac, Android devicesÂ and gaming consoles without requiring reformatting or special drivers for basic use. The included USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables cover connection to virtually any modern device, though you’ll want the C-to-C cable for maximum speed with newer computers. Samsung’s Magician software provides drive health monitoring, firmware updates, and performance optimization tools that help maintain peak performance over the years. The three-year limited warranty backs up Samsung’s confidence in the drive’s reliability, covering manufacturing defects and giving you recourse if something goes wrong.
At $168 for 2TB of fast and reliable Samsung storage, you’re getting the brand’s proven track record at one of the lowest prices this model has ever seen which makes it the right moment to upgrade from slower storage solutions. This Black Friday deal delivers great portable storage at a price that finally makes sense for people who need speed and capacity without emptying their wallets.

49,2025-11-26,"Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures are rising Wednesday as the stock market bets on a Fed interest-rate cut in December."
50,2025-11-26,"The Surface Laptop 13-inch with its excellent Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, and 256GB storage is now just $549 for Black Friday. This is a deal you shouldn't pass up.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Black Friday sales have officially begun, and the Surface Laptop 13-inch with 256GB storage on sale for just $549 at Best Buy because of it. At $350 off its regular price tag, this is the lowest we've ever seen a new Surface Laptop from Microsoft on sale, and at a price that makes recommending this easy.
The Surface Laptop 13-inch is a great laptop with an excellent design and desirable build quality, paired with a top-of-the-class keyboard and trackpad that feel excellent to type with. At this price of $549, it's a total no-brainer!
When the Surface Laptop 13-inch first launched earlier this year, I called it great in our review, but only if you consider it in a vacuum. That was because at its launch price of $899, it was just too expensive to recommend over something like a MacBook Air on a student discount. I said at the time that if you were interested in grabbing one, I'd wait for sales.
For $549 during Black Friday, you're getting yourself a good 1080p LCD touchscreen display, paired with the excellent Snapdragon X Plus SoC and 16GB RAM, making this one of our top Surface Deals this holiday season.
The Surface Laptop 13-inch features a premium build quality, featuring an aluminum chassis that feels just like a MacBook, paired with one of the best keyboards and trackpads you'll find on a Windows PC. The keyboard is tactile yet quiet, and the trackpad is smooth and provides a satisfying click response when you press on it.
It's also Microsoft's best-rated Surface PC when it comes to battery life. It will easily see you through the day with no issues, thanks to the large 50Wh battery, which, when paired with the incredibly efficient Snapdragon X Plus, results in a laptop that just lasts and lasts.
I'd go so far as to say the Surface Laptop 13-inch at $549 is a no-brainer. You're not going to find a better laptop on the market at this price, especially with the build quality and attention to detail that Microsoft is so good at with Surface PCs. This is basically a $549 MacBook Air that runs Windows.
Yes, the Surface Laptop 13-inch features make it a Copilot+ PC thanks to an NPU that outputs 45 TOPS of power, which means it's fully capable of Copilot+ capabilities.
The Surface Laptop 13-inch is Microsoft's midrange alternative to its flagship Surface Laptop 7, which has a 13.8-inch screen. Differences include a 120Hz display on the 13.8-inch model, more CPU, RAM, and storage options, a haptic trackpad, and Windows Hello face unlock instead of a fingerprint.
The deal will last for as long as stock is available, or until the end of Black Friday sales, whichever comes first. So you'll have to be quick!
The Surface Laptop 13-inch is a great laptop with an excellent design and desirable build quality, paired with a top-of-the-class keyboard and trackpad that feel excellent to type with. At this price of $549, it's a total no-brainer!

Here comes the playoff push. It’s go-time for the quarterbacks, whose shoulders will bear the weight and pressure that come with the final stretch before the postseason. Let’s take a look around the league at how these guys are performing.
In these quarterback rankings, I’m focused on monitoring the fluctuations of a quarterback’s performance throughout the season. No one — not even Matthew Stafford — is safe at the top. No one — not even J.J. McCarthy — is stuck at the bottom. There is room for quick ascent — and rapid decline. One question holds most important: What have you done for your team lately?
Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
I’ll just deliver some statistics that contextualize how rough it’s been for McCarthy. To make matters worse, he suffered a concussion last week and will miss time. If backup QB Max Brosmer is at all competent, he might just end up taking over — maybe for the rest of the season.
But again, to the stats:
There’s a way for McCarthy to recover from all this. But it would be against all odds. He has processing problems and throwing motion problems that could take multiple offseasons to fix.

There was a lot to celebrate from this game. Despite his circumstances, Ward is taking steps forward as a passer and operator of his offense. It’s a miracle that Ward hasn’t taken a step back as a player. (Just look at what happened to Caleb Williams last year in Chicago.) But Ward‘s in-season progress — even the smallest forms — makes me wonder if he might see exponential growth with the right coaching staff next year. (Think: Drake Maye.)
In the early phase of the game, likely when Ward was on script, he looked confident and fluent in his progression. There were a number of plays where he looked to have experience beyond his years in the pocket. Ward also flashed his creative side, with a Brett Favre impression — whipping a sidearm throw to his check-down as he fell to the ground — and even a Josh Allen impression — rolling right and slinging the ball across his body into the middle of the field (which is most coaches' nightmare) for a big play.
His potential is outrageous.
The problems started to show up when the Titans appeared to run out of scripted plays. The Seahawks defense appeared to be one step ahead of Ward, who resorted to checkdowns so often that the Seattle defensive backs started jumping those underneath routes. I counted three short throws that could’ve been interceptions — and maybe even pick-sixes.
There’s no surefire way to develop a quarterback, but there have often been bright and steady offensive minds behind the recent developmental success stories. Look at Josh McDaniels and Maye. Look at Ben Johnson and Williams. Look at Kliff Kingsbury and Jayden Daniels.
So … is Mike McCoy that guy?
Is Klint Kubiak that guy?

The situational awareness that has made Hurts so successful is also what seemed to burn him against the Cowboys. 
That situational awareness is what has helped the Eagles protect their lead in so many games. He has taken care of the football, with an absurd .3% interception rate. He has not been aggressive with the lead (and sometimes without it). And, particularly last season, he and Saquon Barkley have taken care of their opponents by killing clock.
That approach failed in Dallas.
And to some degree, A.J. Brown must feel vindicated about his comments over the Eagles’ ""conservative"" approach. Brown had eight catches for 110 yards and a touchdown this week, and was good throughout the game. But when not targeting Brown, Hurts’ production went largely silent in the second half, which opened the door for Dak Prescott and the Cowboys to stage their comeback. In the third quarter, Hurts resorted to checking the ball down and looking off open receivers. And it seemed like he was acting as a directive of the coaching staff, because the playcalling was also conservative. 
On third-and-12, he hit his first read: a 7-yard route from Dallas Goedert. Then Philly punted. That begs the question: Why was that the first read? Well, it was probably to set up Jake Elliott for a field goal. But … he missed it.
The Eagles aren’t broken. But so long as Barkley continues to rush at 3.7 yards per carry, they are going to remain vulnerable. That is, unless Hurts can break his conservative streak and start to convert big plays at the rate he did last postseason.
It felt like neither Jones nor Shane Steichen had an answer for Chiefs DC Steve Spagnuolo’s blitzes. 
The good news is that few NFL offenses do have an answer. Ask Josh Allen.
But the bad news is that the issue showed up time and time again on third downs (and obvious passing situations). And it proved to be the fatal flaw that sunk Indy. Spags stumped Jones on every single third down in the fourth quarter. And the Chiefs kept gifting the ball to Patrick Mahomes, who finally got his first one-possession win of the year.
Interestingly enough, this was a messy game from start to finish for the Colts. They had players running the wrong routes on two crucial plays on two separate drives. One of those mistakes might’ve cost them four points, where they settled for a field goal on a play that could’ve scored (or at least picked up the first down). 
Jones wasn’t great. His play-calling wasn’t great. His pass-catchers weren’t great.
It just felt like a game where the Colts didn’t get the memo that the Chiefs are still the Chiefs. I’m not sure Jones or the Colts are broken heading into the important stretch of their schedule with two games apiece against the Jaguars and the Texans on the horizon.
But the Colts need to sort out their third-down issues — now. Or else they’ll be in danger of giving up what we thought was a dominant lead in the AFC South division. 
They say that sacks are a quarterback stat.
In this case, they’re wrong.
The other logical spot to blame would be the offensive line.
But if you did that, you’d again be wrong.
No, Allen’s career-high eight sacks were largely a product of the Houston Texans’ tight coverage, in which DeMeco Ryans had fierce and founded confidence. So for the Bills, that meant those eight sacks were actually … receiver stats. And let’s not let offensive coordinator Joe Brady off the hook. He’s not doing much to set up his passing game for success, and that’s not just route concepts. It’s also about how he’s setting up pass protection, not giving Allen extra blockers against Will Anderson Jr., Danielle Hunter and company. 
""When they hit the quarterback 12 times, I don’t like that,"" Bills coach Sean McDermott said after the game in Houston. ""I don’t like that stat at all. It’s not a healthy way to play or a healthy way to keep our quarterback healthy through the remainder of the season. So that’s just not a good formula right there.""
But the eight sacks weren’t the only problem for Allen. He also had turnover issues. And I wrote just last week that I sensed this sort of performance was coming. And frankly, it sets the stage for a performance like this in the postseason, too. Allen had a rough game, with two decisions he surely regrets on the two interceptions. 
The problem is that the Bills need more help. They’re not going to get reinforcements from a player personnel standpoint. But … Brian Daboll is out there. He’s the guy who helped Allen have the best statistical season of his career. McDermott said it wasn’t happening.
But … Daboll is out there.
Right now, there’s a strong case of the ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" at quarterback.
Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and even — to some degree — Lamar Jackson are struggling without the support of a true WR1. 
Meanwhile, Prescott, Joe Burrow (when healthy) and Matthew Stafford have excelled because their rosters feature two WR1s.
It’s a matter of preference when deciding who’s ""best"" between the Cowboys, Bengals and Rams receiving corps. But with CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, Dallas is in consideration. That’s a big reason why Prescott looks as good as he has ever looked. He trusts his wideouts with every throw — in some cases too much, as we saw on Prescott’s foolish interception in the red zone.
But this offense proved it will never not be dangerous. Not even down 21 to the Eagles.
It’s probably too little too late for the Cowboys. They have a 9% chance of making the playoffs. They might have to win every game to do it. And they have the Chiefs on Thanksgiving before heading to Detroit for Week 14.
But perhaps Dallas can build a real contender around this offensive core in 2026. That will mean retaining George Pickens on a contract extension. And you’re crazy if you think Jerry Jones will make that process painless.
It doesn’t feel like people are taking the Patriots seriously as Super Bowl contenders, and that’s in large part because of their strength of schedule — or lack thereof. It’s hard to believe in Maye and the Patriots when their best wins have come over the Bills and the Buccaneers.
But Maye’s last game speaks to why New England might somehow be a dark horse. (Can you be a darkhorse when you’re also the No. 1 seed?)
That’s because this was one of his worst games in a while. Or, at the very least, this was one of his worst starts to a game in a while. Hit just three of his first seven passes for 16 yards and an interception. He was struggling with the pressure and seemed to think he could throw every pass off platform (in some cases for no apparent reason).
His wake-up call arrived with an interception that he simply airmailed to tight end Hunter Henry up the seam. There was really no explanation except: Bad, bad, bad throw.
""Probably mentally, not his best performance,"" Pats coach Mike Vrabel said after the game. 
Then things changed. Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels got Maye throwing the ball quickly, with hot routes to beat the blitz and rollouts to get him working across the defense. He did finish the game struggling against man defense. But he also completed a few of the pinpoint passes — some downfield and some through tight windows — that have defined his season.
""They had some good stuff that I didn’t do well directing or get us in the right looks,"" Maye said. ""I have to be better at the line of scrimmage. Credit to them for catching us on some. I have to do my part to help us play cleaner football.""
The reason this performance felt encouraging was that Maye figured out how to beat what the Bengals threw at him. With more film on Maye, opposing defenses will have new challenges ready for him. Especially in the postseason. But he and the Patriots figured out how to work their way through their issues in real time. That might just be the most valuable skill in the playoffs. Of course, it’ll be a lot harder to pull that off against the Chiefs — rather than the Bengals.
But make no mistake: There was a silver lining to New England’s struggles.

Remember the Great PlayStation 5 Panic that hit every holiday season between 2020 and 2023? Relax, we’re not back to those supply-chain nightmare days. But this Amazon Black Friday deal on the Slim Digital Edition of the PS5 â a big $100 price cut down to $399 â is moving with alarming speed, so much so that it might not make it to actual Black Friday. If you weren’t planning on starting your holiday shopping until Black Friday or even Cyber Monday, you might want to rethink that plan if you want to score a PS5 Digital Edition (Slim).
The PS5 Slim’s skinny-sounding name has nothing to do with its gaming power or capabilities, which are fully present. The console itself is about 30% smaller than the first iteration of the PS5. The slender design and the fact it plays equally well when set up in vertical or horizontal position makes is easier to position on your gaming desk or close to your TV in whichever room you’re gaming in. (The vertical stand is sold separately.)
See at Amazon
The last time the PS5 Digital Slim Edition was priced this low was roughly this time one year ago. Since then it’s stubbornly remained in the high-$400s range, but Black Friday 2025 has brought with it a $100 drop â and a serious rush on supply. That’s unsurprising considering the PlayStation’s dominance of the console gaming market, and the PS5’s undisputed reign as the premier console since its release in November 2020. Single-player gaming or online group play are equally fun and immersive, and the number of games that run optimally on the PS5 numbers into the hundreds.
This Slim edition is digital-only â no disc drive present or needed. The digital games load faster and play faster, with far less lag. The internal SSD is a full terabyte in size so you can download new games, updates, and DLCs at will. All you need is a PlayStation Network membership that gives you access to the PlayStation Store to find and download games, and this version of the PS5 comes with Astro’s Playroom pre-installed to get your started.
The smaller, slimmer body of this console is jammed with great, advanced gaming features. It supports haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and 3D audio technology via TV speakers or USB stereo headphones. It supports 4K gaming, is backwards-compatible with PS4 games (digital only), and comes with a DualSense Wireless Controller, power cord, and USB cable.
If you beat the rush and score a PlayStation 5 Digital Slim console during this Amazon deal, your next stop should be the PlayStation Store, where there’s another Black Friday sale happening right now which includes hot new digital games likeÂ The Outer Worlds 2 and hot titles likeÂ NBA 2K26,Â Death Stranding 2: On the Beach,Â Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and over 650 more. They all play fast and furious on the ultra-quick SSD of the PlayStation 5 Digital Slim. But first you have to beat the rush to Amazon and grab one of these consoles for just $399 before this Black Friday deal runs out.

Amazon uses Black Friday to aggressively push its own hardware brands, often slashing their prices to cost or even below to sacrifice profit margins for the sake of market share and locking customers into the Amazon ecosystem. The Fire Max 11 tablet is Amazon’s most serious challenge to iPad dominance and it just dropped to $189 from its usual $279, hitting a record low that includes lockscreen ad removal, normally an extra $20.
See at Amazon
The 11-inch 2000×1200 resolution display provides sharp text and colorful video playback that makes binge-watching Netflix, reading comics, or browsing web content comfortable for extended sessions. The screen size hits the sweet spot between portability and usability, and offers enough real estate for split-screen multitasking or comfortable reading without becoming unwieldy to hold like larger 13-inch tablets. Brightness levels reach adequate intensity for indoor use, though direct sunlight readability suffers compared to premium tablets with higher nit ratings and anti-glare coatings.
The octa-core processor is combined with 4GB of RAM and smoothly runs streaming video, web browsing, casual gaming, and light productivity tasks without the stuttering that plagues cheaper Fire tablets with their anemic specs. You can run multiple apps at the same time through split-screen mode, keeping reference material visible while taking notes or watching videos while you browse social media.
Storage of 128GB gives you ample room for downloaded shows, books, apps, and photos without immediately forcing you into constant storage management or cloud subscriptions. Battery life that reaches as high as 14 hours covers multiple days of typical use, including several hours of video streaming, web browsing, and reading before needing a recharge.
Amazon’s Fire OS interface lays emphasis on Amazon services like Prime Video, Kindle, Audible, and Amazon Music, although you can install third-party apps using the Amazon Appstore. Without access to the Google Play Store, app selection is more limited compared to the standard Android tablets. There are ways around that if you are comfortable with the technical tweaks necessary to sideload apps.
The optional stylus turns the tablet into a capable note-taking device and digital sketchpad, while the stylus is sold separately from the device and increases the overall cost. Handwriting recognition is quite decent for writing quick notes or annotating documents, making the tablet good enough for students or professionals who only require simple digital writing. Laptop-type functionality in extended typing comes with the optional keyboard caseÂ which makes the tablet a lightweight productivity machine for email, editing documents, and web research. These accessories make the tablet more usable than a pure content-consumer device into light work, though serious productivity users will still like full laptops or premium tablets better.
Alexa integration allows for voice control over smart home devices, quick information lookups, and hands-free navigation through some features, though it feels a little less polished than on a dedicated Echo device. The dual speakers are adequate for casual viewing even if serious movie watching and music listening is better with external speakers or headphones.
The inclusion of ad-free lockscreen experience at this bundle price removes one of Fire tablets’ most annoying features that usually require paying more money to turn off. With no ads, the lockscreen displays your wallpaper and helpful information instead of ads for various products and services you couldn’t care less about. While this may seem like a minor quibble and removes ads greatly enhances the user experience and removes the cheapened feeling lockscreen ads provide even on otherwise capable hardware.
You pay just $189, instead of the usual $279, with lockscreen ads already removed, saving you $90 on Amazon’s largest and most capable Fire tablet that competes with entry-level iPads costing nearly double.

55,2025-11-26,"Magic: The Gathering‘s Secret Lair x Monster Hunter drop was revealed just last week. It featured a number of characters and creatures from the hit Capcom multiplayer series and a Sol Ring promo card in each drop. But fans were not impressed. The card selection for the reprints was criticized for being uninspired and having nothing to do with the series it was drawing from. In fact, the fan reaction was so loud that Wizards of the Coast has done something completely unexpected: take the Secret Lair drop back to the drawing board.
“We heard loud and clear that you were disappointed, and we believe we can do better,” the company announced on Wednesday. “We’re going to postpone this release and rework this Superdrop entirely.” Wizards admitted it “missed the mark on elements like card selection and faithfully integrating the world and mechanics of Monster Hunter and plans to rework the Superdrop in the meantime. Details on the new set won’t be re-revealed until next year.
We care a lot about the worlds we get to celebrate, and Secret Lair x Monster Hunter didnât quite come together the way it should have. We hear you, so weâre heading back to the drawing board to rework this Superdrop. More to come.https://t.co/dtHublSB13 pic.twitter.com/yMkaUPaUWI
— MTG Secret Lair (@MTGSecretLair) November 26, 2025

Players had three main complaints about the Secret Lair x Monster Hunter collaboration. The first was that the card selection was pretty bland and not aligned with the series’ lore. Valstrax, the silver Elder Dragon, was a Sol RingÂ despite being neither an artifact nor a ring. Some took issue with the color selection for various references, as well as the card art.
The general bewilderment was best encapsulated by the Champion of Kotoko card, which misspelled Kokoto, the village from the very first Monster Hunter game. It didn’t help that many of the reprinted cards had a second-hand market value well below the $30 and $40 Superdrops.
Upon further inspection some of the Monster Hunter x Magic The Gathering cards don't look too good
Velkhana and Malzeno especially look a bit weird, like they had their face smoothed.

— DarkHero (@DarkHeroCC) November 19, 2025

One MTG YouTuber summed up the response with a video titled “The Monster Hunter Secret Lair Sucks.”
Now that Wizards is redoing the set from scratch, some fans are hopeful it might just go the route of making completely unique cards rather than picking other card reprints to tag with new Monster Hunter names and art. Or Wizards could bring back the “craft” mechanic from Lost Caverns of Ixalan, given MonHon‘s emphasis on creatures and equipment. There have also been requests for Capcom’s own artists to contribute to the illustrations.
Whatever the revised Secret Lair Superdrop ends up being, Wizards says not to get used to this sort of reversal. “Pulling Superdrops back isn’t something we’re going to do very often, but we’re committed to doing better,” the company wrote today. “Capcom is on board for us to take another swing at this Superdrop as well.”

Boomer ShooterDoom EngineIndie of the WeekMohtra 
In first-person shooters, especially older games or retro-inspired boomer shooters, the first gun you get tells you a lot about the game. And in Mohrta, your first weapon is a powerful, accurate, hard-hitting revolver that makes the famous M1-Garand “ping” noise every time you reload it. This is just one of the many reasons why I adore Mohrta, which is out now on Steam.
Mohrta, which launched last month, is a non-linear first-person shooter built in GZDoom that has big Morrowind and Dark Souls vibes. And yes, I know mentioning Dark Souls in a blog or article about video games risks mockery,Â  but the way this game’s save shrines work and the pacing of each of the worlds you visit, plus its challenging boss fights, create very similar vibes to a FromSoftware RPG. Except you have a shotgun. Wait, actually, FromSoftware did that, actually. Huh…anyway, I mentioned Morrowind because Mohtra’s strange dark fantasy universe has similar aesthetics to Bethesda’s popular RPG, too. But again, with more guns.
In Mohrtra, you play as an undead knight-like machine-man who is determined to clean up all the nasty, strange creatures and oddities infesting the land while tracking down someone important. To save the lands and find this person, you’ll need to explore various worlds that ramp up in difficulty, but which can be completed in any order you desire. You start with a powerful sword and badass revolver and grow your arsenal with a shotgun, a bizarre grenade launcher, an SMG that fires bones, and some other really odd weapons I won’t spoil here. All of the weapons feel great, and because the game is built in GZDoom, a modern source port of id’s classic ’90s FPS, gameplay feels snappy, fast, and punchy.
You also have a small talking doll that can heal you and a vulture on your shoulder that provides light when exploring dark caverns or ruins. Mohtra is weird if you haven’t got that yet. But I love it. Returning from levels to the large market hub world is always a treat. The strange denizens of this world are always willing to chat and trade with you, letting you upgrade your gear and guns, making future missions in new worlds easier.
All of this is drenched in gorgeous retro-inspired textures and effects. Forests are foggy and gloomy. Lava-filled caves are dark and foreboding. Ancient ruins look deserted and lonely. Immaculate vibes going in this one. Who needs 4K raytracing when you got the Doom engine?
If you are craving a five-to-seven-hour oddball boomer shooter that isn’t just about running through corridors and killing soldiers or zombies, I’d hop over to Steam and check out Mohtra, one of the best FPS games released this year. And tell me how you think Mohtra is pronounced.Â  I’ve been saying “mow-CH-ru.” But I heard someone say “MAHT-ra.” I don’t know, I’m too busy shooting creepy skeleton men with my bone gun to worry about that kind of stuff.

57,2025-11-26,"Apple is seeking to invalidate a new Indian antitrust penalty formula that allows fines to be based on a company’s global turnover rather than its local revenue. Here are the details.
As reported by Reuters, Apple has filed a constitutional challenge in the Delhi High Court targeting India’s 2024 antitrust penalty provisions, which could fine it up to $38 billion in an antitrust case involving the iOS app market:
“The company is asking judges to declare as illegal the 2024 law that allowed the CCI (Competition Commission of India) to use global turnover, not just that in India, when calculating penalties, according to its 545-page court filing, which is not public.
Apple’s ‘maximum penalty exposure’ at the rate of 10% of its average global turnover derived from all of its services globally for three fiscal years to 2024 could be around $38 billion, it said in the filing.”
The case stems from an ongoing CCI investigation initiated in 2022 after complaints from Match Group and local startups. Last year, the CCI issued a report arguing that Apple had abused its position in the iOS app market.
And while the CCI has not yet issued a final ruling or imposed any penalty, Apple is trying to pre-empt the application of the 2024-revised global turnover formula, which could carry a maximum penalty of $38 billion, per the company’s calculations.
While Apple sees that a “penalty based on global turnover…would be manifestly arbitrary, unconstitutional, grossly disproportionate, unjust,” Match, in turn, believes that this could “act as a significant deterrent against recidivism”.
Apple’s case will be heard next week, but the company may find it challenging to persuade the court, according to Gautam Shahi, a competition law partner consulted by Reuters:
“Amended law is clear that CCI can consider global turnover. (…) It will be difficult to convince the court to interfere with clearly laid down legislative policy.”
What’s your take on this case? Let us know in the comments.

58,2025-11-26,"From tracking your fitness to keeping you connected wherever you go, Apple Watch is a must-have this holiday season. For Black Friday, we’re tracking huge savings on the entire Apple Watch lineup. This includes the cheapest Apple Watch SE 3 and the flagship Apple Watch Series 11. Plus, last year’s Apple Watch Series 10 is still on the market as an excellent middle ground option.
Whether you’re a newcomer to the Apple Watch ecosystem or looking to upgrade your aging wearable, there’s a deal in here for you. 
Apple Watch Series 11 arrived in September, and is almost certainly set to become the best-selling model in the current-generation lineup (if it isn’t already). Now sitting down at the lowest prices we have tracked to date across just about every configuration save for a couple of the very high-end Titanium configs with the Milanese band, even if the base models drop any lower between now and holiday shipping cutoff times, it won’t be by much.
Some might argue an Apple Watch Series 10 at $249 makes the new SE 3 dead on arrival (obsolete), and I’m, frankly, having a hard time taking a position to the contrary. They are functionally quite similar as far as the sorts of features most folks will actually make use of on regular basis, and you can score the SE 3 for $50 less right now, but the Series 10 is (not) arguably a nicer looking piece of high-tech Apple wrist fashion and it’s now starting at $100 less than the new Series 11 for Black Friday – the lowest price it has ever been offered for online.
While I remain a staunch Apple Watch Ultra user, Apple even had me thinking twice about the new SE3 after it announced the always-on display, gesture support, and the S10 chip at the heart of the operation here. I still prefer the Ultra cushion-meets-squircle case, but (on the technical side of things) the SE 3 admittedly does everything I’ll even need an Apple Watch to do, and it does it for $600 less right now with Black Friday pricing in full swing.
The Apple Watch SE 2, which I’m pretty sure stands for Super underwhelming Edition 2 at this point, actually delivers some serious bang for your buck at the $129 Black Friday price. No, it’s very much not a Series 11, not even a Series 10, and it doesn’t have those sweet upgrades Apple injected into the new SE 3 model we just highlighted above. But for the kids or super casual users, this is an Apple Watch for under $130 that does deliver on the basic key feature set at a seriously reduced price right now.
Note: The more valuable GPS + Cell models are at the same price as the base edition, but the colors are far more limited.
Note: The Apple Watch Ultra 2 Black Friday deals are now live but we are still waiting on the Ultra 3. All signs point to something in the range of a $99 discount returning from the early November sales at any time now, but we can’t say for sure – you will be informed and this post will be updated as soon as the price drops. 
Apple Watch Ultra – the most gorgeous wrist computer computing on anyone’s wrist anywhere if you ask me. This thing is very much an investment with that $799 list price, whether you’re looking to save a buck or two on the previous-gen Ultra 2 Black Friday deals or strap up with the latest series 3, but if you’re going to pull the trigger on one now’s the time to do it.

Robot vacuums range from basic bump-and-go models that randomly wander your floors to sophisticated machines that map your home with surgical precision, and Roborock always positioned itself at the premium end with innovations that justify higher price tags. Each new model brings features that push the category forward, but that innovation typically costs serious money, with the flagship Saros 10R normally demanding $1,599 from your wallet.
The great news is that Amazon’s Black Friday deal slashes $600 off that price to bring it down to $999 (38% off) hitting an all-time low that makes this ultra-premium cleaner actually accessible instead of just aspirational. This discount transforms the most advanced robot vacuum on the market into something you can justify buying, and once it starts handling your cleaning routine, you’ll wonder how you ever tolerated doing floors manually.
See at Amazon
The ultra-slim 3.14-inch profile lets this robot slip under furniture that standard vacuums can’t reach, thanks to the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 that eliminates the raised LDS dome making most robot vacuums too tall for low-clearance spaces. You get cleaning coverage under beds, sofas, and cabinets where dust bunnies normally live undisturbed for months because your regular vacuum can’t fit.
3D sensing technology maps your home with precision, even in tight spaces under narrow-legged furniture, while the VertiBeam system navigates around cables without getting stuck or needing you to pre-clean your floors before the robot can do its job. Improved algorithms recognize and adapt to 108 different obstacle types, so it handles everything from pet toys to chair legs without calling for help every five minutes.
The 22,000 Pa HyperForce suction pulls dirt, pet hair, and debris from hardwood, tile, and carpets with enough power to handle embedded mess that weaker vacuums just push around. Combined, the Zero-Tangling DuoDivide main brush and anti-tangle omnidirectional wheels mean you never spend ten minutes cutting hair wraps off the roller bar-which, if you have long hair or pets, is basically the worst part of owning robot vacuums. The FlexiArm side brush and mop automatically extend to reach corners and edges that circular robots typically miss, sweeping along baseboards and into tight spots where crumbs accumulate.
The AdaptiLift chassis climbs over obstacles as high as 4 cm and tackles thresholds and furniture legs that stop lesser robots dead in their tracks and turn your open floor plan into an actual open floor plan rather than a series of isolated zones. The dual-spinning mops automatically lift when carpets get detected to avoid getting your rugs soaked while still making thorough mopping possible on hard floors.
The Multifunctional Dock 4.0 does the dirty work you would avoid by automatically washing mops in 176Â°F hot water and drying them with 131Â°F hot air to prevent mildew and smell. Auto dust collection works for 60 days before needing attention while auto tank refilling and detergent dispensing mean the robot maintains itself between the occasional check-in you give it.
At $999 instead of the usual $1,599, you’re saving $600 on a machine that brings flagship features reserved for people with unlimited home automation budgets. This Black Friday price opens up the most advanced robot vacuum technology to households wanting exceptional cleaning results without compromise on coverage, power, or convenience.

Govee committed fully to Black Friday this year by discounting their entire lighting catalog on Amazon, spanning floor lamps, TV backlights, outdoor permanent lights and table lamps across all price ranges. This sale demonstrates aggressive pricing designed to capture market share during the critical holiday shopping period when buyers make lighting decisions for gifts and home upgrades.
At $53, down from $79, Govee’s RGBIC smart table lamp has hit a record-low price that justifies immediate purchase rather than waiting for future sales that may never match this discount. The 33% savings on Amazon make premium smart lighting accessible to budget-conscious buyers.
See at Amazon
The innovative layout in the advanced RGBICWW LEDs pairs the ability to mix colors in the typical manner in conjunction with the ability to offer independent controls on the segments, in addition to the double-white LEDs. This arrangement provides an unbridled ability to express a range of colors and allows different segments of the light source to glow in their choice of different colors, an effect that would be difficult to offer in lighting units that only offer single-color segments. The warm white and cool LEDs, each at 2700K and 6500K respectively, provide proper light and prevent the typical bluish effect commonly offered in the mix of lights in the RGB arrangement.
The preset scene modes (64 in total) remove the complexity involved in programming by using professionally designed light effects that have been optimized for different moods, events, and activities. Scenes designed for Valentine’s Day provide pink and red light settings, birthday scenes change in a rainbow pattern, relaxation scenes provide blue-green settings, and focus scenes provide lightening in the brightest white, optimal for concentration. There are eight music syncing scenes that analyze audio through the microphone in your phone, pulsating lights in time with the beat and this transitions listening experiences into performances.
Matter protocol support is the biggest leap in the world of smart homes in a long time because it provides interoperability between Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings on a single universal standard. The factor that hampered the adoption of the old smart technology was the need to be locked into an ecosystem from the beginning which makes it difficult when you wanted other ecosystems in the future.
The pat-to-wake feature takes care of the problem encountered by all people when you need light and end up patting in the dark in search of the switch and the screen of your phone: All you need to do here is touch the top side of the touch-sensitive lamp. The process has some limitations, in that you need to enable the bedtime feature from the Govee application in order to have the functionality work
The Govee Home application provides the ability to customize your lighting plans through DIY and allows the setting up of personalized light displays using the application’s functionalities, such as selecting the desired lights, speeds, and programming the lights in segments that create your desired personal light effects.
With a discounted price tag of $53, the Govee smart table lamp boasts an output of 500 lumens, separate multi-color segments, the Matter protocol, 64 preset scenes, music sync, and DIY scene setting, all at 33% off the retailers’ price on this Black Friday.

61,2025-11-26,"Snag a month or three of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate during Black Friday and save money for next year's games.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Black Friday deals are ramping up, and right now, there is a great offer for anyone looking to stock up on some of their gaming subscriptions. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate currently goes for $30 a month in the U.S. following a recent price hike, but right now, you can get codes for just $20 a month via Amazon, or at $60 for three months. Either way, that's a 33% discount over what you'll usually pay. If you're subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on a monthly or quarterly basis, then grabbing a couple of codes and stocking up for cheap is a simple no-brainer. You'll pay less to get access to all the games and features you normally use.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate brings access to EA Play, Fortnite Crew, and most importantly, day one Xbox first-party releases. The subscription recently shot up in price, but you can snag it at $20 a month again during this Black Friday sale. 
 



This Black Friday discount is a great opportunity to stock up on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, because 2026 is looking to be a repeat of 2025's Xbox first-party onslaught. There are numerous games currently slated to launch next year, with something for everyone, depending on your tastes.
Halo Studios is launching Halo: Campaign Evolved, a remake of Combat Evolved that adds new missions, cinematics, and more. Meanwhile, The Coalition is also arriving with Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel story that shows Marcus and Dom fighting to survive the titular event.
Playground Games has a double feature in store, with Forza Horizon 6 set in Japan, while the developer is also finally set to launch Fable, a reboot of the iconic Xbox role-playing game series.
That's just on the first-party side. Looking over at Xbox's third-party partners, there are games on the way like the musical-decorating-horror mashup There Are No Ghosts at the Grand, as well as the coming-of-age adventure Mixtape, and many more.
If you save now on Xbox Game Pass, you can use some of that savings to take advantage of a concurrent Xbox Gift Card deal and stock up.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate brings access to EA Play, Fortnite Crew, and most importantly, day one Xbox first-party releases. The subscription recently shot up in price, but you can snag it at $20 a month again during this Black Friday sale. 
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the top tier of Xbox Game Pass, and it includes hundreds of games for console and PC, as well as EA Play (giving access to older EA-published titles), Ubisoft+ Classics (a selection of older Ubisoft games), and most importantly, day one Xbox first-party releases. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also includes Riot Games benefits, with every new character unlocked in games like League of Legends and Valorant.
After a recent price hike, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now costs $30 a month in the U.S. That's a significant increase from the prior price, which was just $20 a month.

62,2025-11-26,"Dmitry Nuyanzin was reportedly trying to gain, and then lose, 50 lbs. to promote his fitness program
Dmitry Nuyanzin/Instagram
 A fitness coach went into fatal cardiac arrest after partaking in a binge-eating challenge where he tried to gain more than 50 lbs. — and then lose it — to promote his new weight-loss program.

 Dmitry Nuyanzin, a fitness coach and influencer from the Russian city of Orenburg, spent weeks eating 10,000 calories a day in a bid to gain more than 50 lbs. His plan was to then lose the weight with his new fitness program, per translations from Russian social media posts, reported Daily Mail.

 The 30-year-old began to feel unwell, the outlet reports, and canceled his training sessions, telling friends he was going to see a doctor. He died in his sleep of cardiac arrest.

Getty (2)
 Nuyanzin had gained nearly 30 lbs. in a month as part of his challenge. He’d promised to pay $100 to anyone who lost 10% of their body weight using his program by New Year’s.  ""My WEIGHT LOSS COURSE is starting soon, where you can win cool prizes and, most importantly, build a beautiful body, learn how to eat and have fun!,"" he wrote in what appeared to be his Instagram account. ""I’m going to be losing weight with my minions, so this will be twice as exciting!""

 On Nov. 18, he’d shared that he weighed more than 230 lbs.

 His weight gain was aided by cholesterol-laden foods, he’d said, per the outlet. 

 “For breakfast, I have a plate of pastries and half a cake. For lunch, I usually eat 800 grams [nearly 2 lbs.] of dumplings with mayonnaise,” he’d said. “During the day, I may snack on crisps, and for dinner, I have a burger and two small pizzas, either at a café or delivered.”

 Nuyanzin was remembered fondly on social media, Daily Mail reported: “I'm in total shock. Why does God take the best people?” wrote one tribute, while others remembered him as an “incredible person” and “bright.”

 Excess weight can cause strain on the heart, Brown University explains. “The larger the body, the harder the heart must work to pump and circulate the blood. Extra weight also gives the body volume, which creates more resistance for the heart to overcome as it pumps.”

    Following the launch of the iPhone 17, Apple is set to overtake Samsung phone shipments for the first time in 14 years, according to an analyst report.
  
Apple's latest iPhones, including the 17 Pro, helped push it past Samsung in global smartphone shipments, according to a new market report.
Apple is set to dethrone Samsung as the world's top smartphone maker in 2025 and is expected to maintain that lead through at least 2029, according to a market report forecast from Counterpoint Research published Wednesday.
Counterpoint projects that global shipments of smartphones from Apple will grow by 9% year over year for the third quarter of 2025, pushing it past Samsung for the first time in 14 years. Shipments of the iPhone 17 lineup, including the iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max exceeded expectations, per the report. Samsung shipments grew 4.6% year over year for the same quarter.

Counterpoint senior analyst Yang Wang said that the reception for the iPhone 17 lineup was positive, and that customers replacing their older iPhones have given the tech giant a sizeable boost. ""Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,"" Wang said. ""Furthermore, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and Q2 2025. These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years.""
Apple has delayed some AI features, including a revamped Siri with Apple Intelligence, but that has not seemed to hurt its iPhone sales, Counterpoint noted. Sales have been higher for the iPhone 17 than they were for the iPhone 16 released last year, notably in the US and China, according to the report.
Counterpoint expects that Apple's introduction of a foldable iPhone and budget models, like an anticipated iPhone 17E that could launch as the company moves away from an annual release cycle, will help Apple continue its dominance over the next few years. The global smartphone market share for Apple will reach 19.4%, according to Counterpoint, compared with Samsung at 18.7%."

The Department of Justice and the real estate platform RealPage just made a deal, and since it doesnât completely dismantle RealPage, itâs not going to be seen as a total victory for tenants who hate RealPage. But itâs something, and it will most likely weaken the platformâs power to raise rents, as it will now be prevented from shuffling together nonpublic information from competing landlords when setting prices.
According to the New York Times RealPage still denies having done anything wrong, per statements from Stephen Weissman, an attorney representing RealPage. The company is glad the government was willing to “bless the legality of RealPageâs prior and planned product changes,” Weissman said,Â âThere has been a great deal of misinformation about how RealPageâs software works and the value it provides for both housing providers and renters.â
RealPage, founded in 1998, is a multifaceted tool for landlords, not just a pricing aid. Its suite of features has been, according to press coverage and the federal charges that led to this settlement, an unseen poltergeist in rentersâ lives for years, making life generally more miserable, even while most tenants had no idea it exists. For instance, according to a 2020 investigation by the New York Times and The Markup, RealPage was using flawed algorithms to perform background checks, and landlords were denying people homes based on nonexistent criminal charges.
When it came to rents, RealPage itself at one point claimed that the landlords who used it faithfully were âdriving every possible opportunity to increase price even in the most downward trending or unexpected conditions.â
Then in August of last year, the Justice Departmentâalong with eight state attorney generalsâslapped RealPage with an antitrust suit. The legal filing makes for immensely gratifying reading, particularly when you know RealPage settled after being hit with the following accusation:
âAt bottom, RealPage is an algorithmic intermediary that collects, combines, and exploits landlordsâ competitively sensitive information. And in so doing, it enriches itself and compliant landlords at the expense of renters who pay inflated prices and honest businesses that would otherwise compete.â
The price recommendation systems in RealPage, called YieldStar and AI Revenue Management, worked by asking usersâlandlordsâto enter nonpublic data on rental real estate that only landlords would generally have. That included private data from applications, rent amounts, leases renewed, units sitting unoccupied, and other numbers of this nature that can be used to quantify the state of the market in extremely granular detail. Not all of this data is part of the most recent version of RealPageâs software, but itâs how it worked historically.
All this market information was heaped into a pile and combined with the data piles of other landlords, who are theoretically their competitors. The system would process all of this with an algorithm, and generate bespoke price recommendations for all landlords in an area, all using one another’s data.
Making its data all the more comprehensive was its 80 percent market share, according to the DOJ. That alleged monopoly status theoretically meant landlords paid higher prices for RealPage, which were passed on to renters.
And it apparently made rents go up. A 2022 ProPublica investigation found widespread RealPage adoption, and widespread rent increases to go with it. In Nashville, prices had recently gone up 14.5%, and ProPublica found that landlords were thrilled. In a testimonial, a real estate revenue manager said “The beauty of YieldStar is that it pushes you to go places that you wouldnât have gone if you werenât using it,” according to ProPublica.
So instead of competing with one another to earn rents from people who need housing, the lawsuit claimed that, landlords joined forces with other landlords, and turned their competitive drives against their tenants. They didn’t actually set foot in a room with one another to engage in sinister price-fixing meetings. The software allegedly took care of it all for them.Â 
If the settlement is approved by a North Carolina judge, RealPage will no longer be allowed to use information from current leases to train its algorithm, or to mix nonpublic data from different landlords together when making price recommendations.Â 
Gail Slater, the DOJ’s antitrust division leader was quoted in a government news release as saying, âCompeting companies must make independent pricing decisions, and with the rise of algorithmic and artificial intelligence tools, we will remain at the forefront of vigorous antitrust enforcement.âÂ

Naming your layers? You don’t even want to see the photoshop files that made these enigmatic image experiments.
Belén Segu found her dreamy, surreal style of image making somewhere in between her layers on Photoshop. Approaching the tool as a way to uncover the endless possibilities for “distorting and manipulating” a singular image, the Chilean visual artist has been following what she refers to as an “erratic process – endless filters, brushes, effects, dislocations, and layers upon layers upon layers” forming new images out of old ones.
The artist has always been fond of collecting imagery, carefully compiling her own archives of found things. “At some point, I realised they all shared a common factor: objects, porcelain figures, jewelry, furniture, desserts – all of them referring to a certain past era,” she says. That’s why a lot of her pieces make you feel like you’re staring into some kind of surreal flea market feverdream. Many of these fuzzy objects are things the artist “cannot possess”, leaving her with only the possibility of archiving and collecting them in image form.
With this precious source imagery Belén sets out to replicate, distort and “stretch pixels until they burst”, working until a completely different picture appears: “a new, hybrid image, made with a mixed technique — a technique that I don’t even really know myself”, she says. This explains why each of Belén’s illustrations are made completely differently. Some of her works are of things that she might have painted partly, some are interpretations of objects she found on eBay and reimaged as something else entirely. “Perhaps I took a chair from eBay and transformed it by merging it with the head of a dog that wears a pearl necklace,” she says.
Whichever way her process decides to take shape, the artist’s aim is to collate somewhat of a “grotesque photomontage” that will later be “softened and unified, as if everything had always been together”, she shares. This heavily edited multilayered approach results in endlessly fascinating enigmatic pieces that withhold the magic of their making. “Perhaps that very procedure is what builds a particular, strange, and dreamlike style,” Belén ends.

Wall Street pulled back on bearish takes for Oracle, boosting the company’s stock and founder Larry Ellison’s spot as the world’s third-richest person ahead of Google cofounder Sergey Brin, as the markets continue to re-order the perceived winners in the AI race.  
Shares of Oracle rose more than 4% to around $205 as of Wednesday afternoon, marking a slight rebound for the stock after declining 35% from a high of $287 on Oct. 27 to a low of just over $185 on Tuesday.
Alphabet’s shares traded down 1.4% to around $319, ending a 13% rally for the Google parent since Friday.
The jostling for position among the richest in the world comes as the market has moved approvingly for Alphabet’s AI strategy, while cooling on many others, including Oracle’s and Microsoft’s (Brin’s Google cofounder, Larry Page, remains at No. 2 after supplanting Ellison and Microsoft founder Bill Gates).
An advancement for Oracle’s shares follows a period of uncertainty surrounding the company, as more investors reportedly traded against the company as part of a broader bet against AI, though Deutsche Bank analysts disputed the concerns Wednesday, writing the company was getting “little if any credit” for its AI business.
HSBC similarly issued a bullish opinion, arguing that investors were confused by Oracle’s lack of details when disclosing the company had $500 billion in future contracted work and that markets had been “filling in the blanks with little concrete information.”
Ellison has an estimated net worth of $256.4 billion, ranking him the third-wealthiest person in the world after an increase in Oracle’s share price added $8.9 billion Wednesday. Ellison reclaimed the rank from Brin, who rose as high as No. 3 on Tuesday and whose net worth is now estimated at $242.4 billion. Brin’s wealth dropped about $3.1 billion on Wednesday as Alphabet’s shares declined. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos ranks just behind Brin at No. 5 with a net worth of $242 billion."

Omnicom has closed its acquisition of rival Interpublic in an all-stock deal reshaping the advertising and marketing sectors and creating the world’s largest ad holding company.

	The combined company, with a pro forma combined revenue in excess of $25 billion, will trade under the OMC ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. John Wren remains Chairman & CEO. The full management team will be unveiled on December 1.

	The transaction, valued at around $13 billion, was announced last December. Interpublic shares at that point jumped 11% on the news, while Omnicom stock slid 7%, with the moves emulating the classic pattern of a merger.

	Of the four major holding companies, Omnicom and Interpublic are Nos. 3 and 4, respectively, based on revenue. Only Publicis and WPP are larger. The majors have not tried to combine since Pubicis and Omnicom announced a merger in 2013, though the proposed transaction was never completed.




			Watch on Deadline		






	Motivating the merger are a complex set of factors shaping the current operating environment. Advertising is a big business and growing larger, with global spending projected to top $1 trillion in 2025, but technology and AI have posed challenges to many traditional players. 

	After the close of the deal, Omnicom shareholders will own 60.6% of the new entity, with Interpublic shareholders getting the remaining 39.4%. The combined company will keep the name Omnicom, trading under the current ticker symbol, OMC. Annual cost savings of $750 million are expected to result from the combination.

	“This strategic acquisition creates significant value for both sets of shareholders by combining world-class, highly complementary data and technology platforms enabling new offerings to better serve our clients and drive growth,” Wren said in the official announcement. “Through this combination, we are poised to accelerate innovation and harness the significant opportunities created by new technologies in this era of exponential change. Now is the perfect time to bring together our technologies, capabilities, talent and geographic footprints to bring clients superior, data-driven outcomes.”

	










	Philippe Krakowsky, who is Interpublic’s CEO and will be on the board of directors of the new company, called the deal “a tremendous strategic opportunity for our stakeholders.” He said the two companies have “highly complementary offerings, geographic presence and cultures. We also share a foundational belief in the power of ideas, enabled by technology and data.”

75,2025-11-26,"The iPhone Pocket is probably unchallenged as the weirdest accessory the company has ever sold, beating out the iPod sock. But if you were, for some reason, planning to buy one, you may now have missed your chance … 
The iPhone Pocket was launched just two weeks ago. Created by Japanese design house Issey Miyake. Apple described it as offering a delightful mix of craftsmanship and simplicity.
“Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE share a design approach that celebrates craftsmanship, simplicity, and delight,” said Molly Anderson, Apple’s vice president of Industrial Design. “This clever extra pocket exemplifies those ideas and is a natural accompaniment to our products. The colour palette of iPhone Pocket was intentionally designed to mix and match with all our iPhone models and colours — allowing users to create their own personalised combination. Its recognizable silhouette offers a beautiful new way to carry your iPhone, AirPods, and favourite everyday items.”
It was sold in only eight countries: France, Greater China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the UK, and the US.
While the iPhone Pocket quickly found itself the butt of a great many jokes, it also appeared to be surprisingly popular. It went out of stock in the United States within the first few days and as MacRumors notes is now unavailable from any Apple store worldwide. As it was only ever launched as a limited edition, it’s possible that it may not be sold again.
It followed the launch of another surprising Apple accessory, the Crossbody Strap. This one tapped into a somewhat popular fashion trend, with the Pocket taking the idea to the next level. While Apple’s version costs $59, there are versions available on Amazon from just a few dollars.
If you’re tempted to pick up the genuine item on eBay, check the listing wordings very carefully, as many of them say in the small print that they are third-party copies.

JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting that the dip is an opportunity.

					Sending You to Google News in 3

© 24/7 Wall St.
It’s always a good idea to keep track of analysts’ stock upgrades.
Often, they’re influenced by (1) company fundamentals, such as financial health, future growth, and even meetings with management; (2) industry and market trends, including specific market conditions and economics; (3) earnings and financial data, including earnings reports that came in better than expected, or competitive analysis of a competitor, and (4) guidance.
However, before jumping into a stock just because your favorite analyst upgraded it, do your own due diligence, fundamentally and technically.
That being said, here are a few heavy-hitters seeing upgrades.
JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).
The firm says the dip is an opportunity, noting that shares re-traced to pre-earnings levels and are now about 10% off November highs. Just yesterday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon, noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays.
Not long ago, analysts at KeyBanc Capital said Amazon should benefit from the AI boom. The analysts say Amazon’s AWS is still growing strong. It also believes that the ramp of gigawatt data center clusters and customers like Anthropic are potential drivers of revenue acceleration into 2026. The analysts have an overweight rating on AMZN with a $300 price target.
Heading into earnings next week, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) just saw a price target hike from Goldman Sachs. With a new target of $435, up from $380, the firm expects to see further sustained strength in artificial intelligence.
It also expects to see updated 2026 AI revenue guidance above 100% year-over-year. “The analyst sees AI revenue for fiscal year 2026 to come in at $45.4 billion, marking an approximate year-over-year rise of 128%. This could reach $77.3 billion in 2027, rising 70% year over year,” added CNBC.
Analysts at Raymond James also resumed their outperform rating on Broadcom.  With a price target of $420 a share, the firm “cited Broadcom’s position as a share gainer in the AI sector, providing operators with customized alternatives to general-purpose processors. Raymond James expects continued upward estimate revisions to support its positive rating on the stock,” as noted by Investing.com.
Analysts at Piper Sandler upgraded Oscar Health (NYSE: OSCR) to an overweight rating with a price target of $25 from $13. The firm noted that with enhanced premium tax credits (E-APTCs) expiring at the end of the year, OSCR’s market share and margins should expand.
“If the E-APTCs are allowed to expire at the end of CY25, OSCR believes Individual ACA Marketplace enrollment could decline (20.0%) to (30.0%) in CY26. This projection implies that the Individual ACA Market sheds ~6.1M lives y/y; with enrollment collapsing from ~24.3M in CY25 to ~18.2M in CY26,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “It reflects the confluence of expiring E-APTCs and federal efforts to strengthen program integrity.”

Mark Gurman at Bloomberg has previously reported that Apple’s next iPad mini will get a big display upgrade, moving from LCD to OLED.
As for launch timing, Gurman has only said “as early as next year.”
But Instant Digital just narrowed that window.
In a pair of posts on Weibo today, the leaker said we shouldn’t expect to see the new iPad mini in the first half of 2026. Instead, he writes the following (English translation):
The earliest it will be released is the third or fourth quarter of next year.
The last couple of iPad mini models have been released in October and September, respectively. So a fall launch for the new OLED model would be consistent with that.
We are still expecting new base iPad and iPad Air models earlier in the year. So prior to this report, it seemed very possible that the new iPad mini would arrive in early 2026 as well.
But now it appears anyone in the market for an iPad mini with OLED will need to wait until at least next September.

The federal government has announced the results of the latest round of Medicare drug price negotiations: 15 lower drug prices for Medicare to go into effect in 2027.
Medicare will get a 71% discount on Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus, blockbuster drugs for obesity and Type 2 diabetes that have current list prices of around a thousand dollars a month.
The negotiations also included drugs for asthma, breast cancer and leukemia. The discounts ranged from 38% for Austedo, which treats Huntington's disease, to 85% for Janumet for Type 2 diabetes.
""President Trump directed us to stop at nothing to lower health care costs for the American people,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., in a press release. ""As we work to Make America Healthy Again, we will use every tool at our disposal to deliver affordable health care to seniors.""
The program that covers drugs for more than 50 million seniors negotiated its first batch of drug prices last year, after the passage of the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. 
A provision of that law, passed without Republican support, ended Medicare's 20-year ban on negotiating drug prices.
Negotiations for this second batch of 15 drugs wrapped up at the end of October.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) say the new, lower Medicare prices would have saved the program $12 billion dollars if the lower negotiated prices had been in effect in 2024.
The latest negotiated prices are great news for taxpayers and patients, says Dr. Benjamin Rome, health policy researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Federal taxpayers fund much of Medicare, but beneficiaries also must pay copays and coinsurance.
""This is more savings than the first round, but a lot of that has to do with the nature of the drugs being negotiated this year and probably some learning from experience,"" he says.
Drugs were selected earlier this year based on criteria written into the law. They had to have no generic or biosimilar competition, account for a high amount of Medicare spending and be on the market for a number of years.
The lower Ozempic and Wegovy prices follow a separate deal the Trump administration announced on Nov. 6 with Novo Nordisk, which makes both drugs.
That deal was part of the president's push to get drug companies to voluntarily lower their U.S. prices to match those in other developed countries.
But, confusingly, the discounts from the Medicare negotiations were less significant than what Novo Nordisk agreed to give Medicare as part of the Nov. 6 deal.
That previous deal set a price of $245 dollars a month for Ozempic and Wegovy. But according to the negotiated prices announced this week, the prices of Ozempic, Wegovy and Rybelsus — the company's Type 2 diabetes pill — will be $274 a month.
""It's not clear why Novo [Nordisk] would promise a different price in two different venues,"" Rome says.
In a company statement, Novo Nordisk explained that it ""look[s] forward to additional clarity from CMS on how pricing and coverage will work.""
The separate Trump Administration deal ""reflects a broader effort to expand access to obesity care across Medicare and Medicaid,"" the statement said. 
(The deal expanded access in those two programs to the drugs to people with a body mass index of over 35 and people with BMIs above 27 who have additional health conditions. But the details of exactly how this will work remain unclear.)
The Novo Nordisk statement affirmed that the company is committed to advocating for affordable access to its medications, but ""we continue to have serious concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's impact on patients and remain opposed to government price setting.""
AARP, an advocacy group for the 125 million Americans who are 50 and older, was pleased with the results of the negotiations.
""Today's announcement marks yet another significant next step forward in our long-standing efforts to lower prescription drug prices,"" AARP's CEO Dr. Myechia Minter-Jordan said in a statement.
""Older Americans across the political spectrum consistently say lower drug prices are a top priority, and these negotiated prices will bring meaningful relief to millions of people on Medicare.""

80,2025-11-26,"Professionally refurbed espresso machines at Black Friday-beating prices

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

There are some fantastic Black Friday deals on coffee makers this year, but it's possible to get your dream machine even cheaper by opting for a refurbished model rather than new. Back Market is a global marketplace that specialises in professionally refurbed tech, and has TechRadar's seal of approval as a legitimate retailer – and it's holding a special sale on Sage espresso machines right now.
• Shop all Back Market's deals on Sage coffee makers
When you're buying a refurbished coffee maker from Back Market, it will be listed as either 'excellent' or 'good'. 'Excellent' products have almost no signs of wear, while 'good' means light signs of wear (no scratches visible from about arm's length). Learn more about your device's condition.
For example, you can pick up the excellent Sage Barista Express for just £384 in 'good' condition, or £455.99 for 'excellent' (was £599). We gave this espresso machine four and a half stars in our review, and both discounts are a steal.
Our reviewer praised the Barista Express for its ease of use, with highly customisable brew settings. Highlights include an auto-tamper for perfectly-formed pucks, and built-in pressure gauge. It costs £384 if you opt for 'good' condition, or £455.99 for 'excellent'. This one is finished in stainless steel, but the same machine is also available in Sesame Black from £472.49.
This version of the Barista Express has Sage's smart Express Puck system, which tamps down your coffee without you removing the portafilter from the grinder. No more grounds spilled over your kitchen. This refurbed model is less than half price in 'good' condition.
The Barista Pro is another superb semi-automatic espresso machine, and according to Sage it can reach temperature in just three seconds thanks to its ThermoJet heating system. It's £503.74 in 'good' condition at Back Market, or £560.49 for 'excellent' – a great saving either way.
I reviewed this premium espresso machine just a few months ago, and it makes some of the most authentic-tasting cold brew I've had from a home coffee maker. Its steam wand is particularly good as well (see my full review for more details). You'll get a huge 41% off if you opt for 'good' condition at Back Market, or 27% for 'excellent'.
Remember that all products at Back Market are in limited stock, so if a deal catches your eye it's wise to snap it up as soon as possible. If the one you wanted has sold out, take a look at the complete list of coffee makers, where the same model may be listed under a different name or a serial number.
If a Sage coffee maker is listed with just a number, a quick search of Sage's website should reveal exactly which model it is (for example, anything listed as SES990BSS is a Sage Oracle Touch).
All products purchased from Back Market are covered by a one-year warranty, with 30-day free returns if you're not completely happy. Check out the Back Market Promise for more details.

81,2025-11-26,"ByteDance had bought more Nvidia chips than any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power.
By Reuters
Share
Save
Chinese regulators have barred TikTok-owner ByteDance from deploying Nvidia chips in new data centres.
The tech publication The Information first reported the development on Wednesday, citing two company employees.
ByteDance bought more Nvidia chips than any other Chinese firm in 2025 as it raced to secure computing power for its billion-plus users amid concerns the United States could curb supply, according to the report.
The reported ban underscores Beijing’s efforts to reduce reliance on US technology, a campaign that has intensified as Washington tightens curbs on exports of advanced semiconductors to China.
In August, Chinese regulators asked local firms to halt new orders of Nvidia AI chips and have since pushed companies to adopt homegrown processors, Bloomberg reported, citing people close to Chinese tech regulators.
“The regulatory landscape does not allow us to offer a competitive data centre GPU in China, leaving that massive market to our rapidly growing foreign competitors,” a Nvidia spokesperson told the Reuters news agency.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that the Chinese government had issued guidance requiring new data centre projects that have received any state funds to only use domestically-made artificial intelligence (AI) chips.
China is accelerating plans to build an alternative AI ecosystem and achieve chip self-sufficiency, even as trade tensions with Washington remain in a fragile pause.
Washington has barred sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China, allowing only scaled-down versions, such as the H20. Nvidia had introduced a China-specific chip, but demand has been tepid, with some major tech firms opting not to place orders.
Following talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month, US President Donald Trump said that Washington will “let them deal with Nvidia but not in terms of the most advanced” chips.
On Wall Street, Nvidia stock is up by 1.8 percent in midday trading.

Here comes the playoff push. It’s go-time for the quarterbacks, whose shoulders will bear the weight and pressure that come with the final stretch before the postseason. Let’s take a look around the league at how these guys are performing.
In these quarterback rankings, I’m focused on monitoring the fluctuations of a quarterback’s performance throughout the season. No one — not even Matthew Stafford — is safe at the top. No one — not even J.J. McCarthy — is stuck at the bottom. There is room for quick ascent — and rapid decline. One question holds most important: What have you done for your team lately?
Previous: Preseason, Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
I’ll just deliver some statistics that contextualize how rough it’s been for McCarthy. To make matters worse, he suffered a concussion last week and will miss time. If backup QB Max Brosmer is at all competent, he might just end up taking over — maybe for the rest of the season.
But again, to the stats:
There’s a way for McCarthy to recover from all this. But it would be against all odds. He has processing problems and throwing motion problems that could take multiple offseasons to fix.

With Bryce Young enduring another uneven season, should the Panthers exercise his fifth-year option this offseason? (Photo by Brooke Sutton/Getty Images) 
There was a lot to celebrate from this game. Despite his circumstances, Ward is taking steps forward as a passer and operator of his offense. It’s a miracle that Ward hasn’t taken a step back as a player. (Just look at what happened to Caleb Williams last year in Chicago.) But Ward‘s in-season progress — even the smallest forms — makes me wonder if he might see exponential growth with the right coaching staff next year. (Think: Drake Maye.)
In the early phase of the game, likely when Ward was on script, he looked confident and fluent in his progression. There were a number of plays where he looked to have experience beyond his years in the pocket. Ward also flashed his creative side, with a Brett Favre impression — whipping a sidearm throw to his check-down as he fell to the ground — and even a Josh Allen impression — rolling right and slinging the ball across his body into the middle of the field (which is most coaches' nightmare) for a big play.
His potential is outrageous.
The problems started to show up when the Titans appeared to run out of scripted plays. The Seahawks defense appeared to be one step ahead of Ward, who resorted to checkdowns so often that the Seattle defensive backs started jumping those underneath routes. I counted three short throws that could’ve been interceptions — and maybe even pick-sixes.
There’s no surefire way to develop a quarterback, but there have often been bright and steady offensive minds behind the recent developmental success stories. Look at Josh McDaniels and Maye. Look at Ben Johnson and Williams. Look at Kliff Kingsbury and Jayden Daniels.
So … is Mike McCoy that guy?
Is Klint Kubiak that guy?

The situational awareness that has made Hurts so successful is also what seemed to burn him against the Cowboys. 
That situational awareness is what has helped the Eagles protect their lead in so many games. He has taken care of the football, with an absurd .3% interception rate. He has not been aggressive with the lead (and sometimes without it). And, particularly last season, he and Saquon Barkley have taken care of their opponents by killing clock.
That approach failed in Dallas.
And to some degree, A.J. Brown must feel vindicated about his comments over the Eagles’ ""conservative"" approach. Brown had eight catches for 110 yards and a touchdown this week, and was good throughout the game. But when not targeting Brown, Hurts’ production went largely silent in the second half, which opened the door for Dak Prescott and the Cowboys to stage their comeback. In the third quarter, Hurts resorted to checking the ball down and looking off open receivers. And it seemed like he was acting as a directive of the coaching staff, because the playcalling was also conservative. 
On third-and-12, he hit his first read: a 7-yard route from Dallas Goedert. Then Philly punted. That begs the question: Why was that the first read? Well, it was probably to set up Jake Elliott for a field goal. But … he missed it.
The Eagles aren’t broken. But so long as Barkley continues to rush at 3.7 yards per carry, they are going to remain vulnerable. That is, unless Hurts can break his conservative streak and start to convert big plays at the rate he did last postseason.
It felt like neither Jones nor Shane Steichen had an answer for Chiefs DC Steve Spagnuolo’s blitzes. 
The good news is that few NFL offenses do have an answer. Ask Josh Allen.
But the bad news is that the issue showed up time and time again on third downs (and obvious passing situations). And it proved to be the fatal flaw that sunk Indy. Spags stumped Jones on every single third down in the fourth quarter. And the Chiefs kept gifting the ball to Patrick Mahomes, who finally got his first one-possession win of the year.
Interestingly enough, this was a messy game from start to finish for the Colts. They had players running the wrong routes on two crucial plays on two separate drives. One of those mistakes might’ve cost them four points, where they settled for a field goal on a play that could’ve scored (or at least picked up the first down). 
Jones wasn’t great. His play-calling wasn’t great. His pass-catchers weren’t great.
It just felt like a game where the Colts didn’t get the memo that the Chiefs are still the Chiefs. I’m not sure Jones or the Colts are broken heading into the important stretch of their schedule with two games apiece against the Jaguars and the Texans on the horizon.
But the Colts need to sort out their third-down issues — now. Or else they’ll be in danger of giving up what we thought was a dominant lead in the AFC South division. 
They say that sacks are a quarterback stat.
In this case, they’re wrong.
The other logical spot to blame would be the offensive line.
But if you did that, you’d again be wrong.
No, Allen’s career-high eight sacks were largely a product of the Houston Texans’ tight coverage, in which DeMeco Ryans had fierce and founded confidence. So for the Bills, that meant those eight sacks were actually … receiver stats. And let’s not let offensive coordinator Joe Brady off the hook. He’s not doing much to set up his passing game for success, and that’s not just route concepts. It’s also about how he’s setting up pass protection, not giving Allen extra blockers against Will Anderson Jr., Danielle Hunter and company. 
""When they hit the quarterback 12 times, I don’t like that,"" Bills coach Sean McDermott said after the game in Houston. ""I don’t like that stat at all. It’s not a healthy way to play or a healthy way to keep our quarterback healthy through the remainder of the season. So that’s just not a good formula right there.""
But the eight sacks weren’t the only problem for Allen. He also had turnover issues. And I wrote just last week that I sensed this sort of performance was coming. And frankly, it sets the stage for a performance like this in the postseason, too. Allen had a rough game, with two decisions he surely regrets on the two interceptions. 
The problem is that the Bills need more help. They’re not going to get reinforcements from a player personnel standpoint. But … Brian Daboll is out there. He’s the guy who helped Allen have the best statistical season of his career. McDermott said it wasn’t happening.
But … Daboll is out there.
Right now, there’s a strong case of the ""haves"" and ""have-nots"" at quarterback.
Patrick Mahomes, Josh Allen and even — to some degree — Lamar Jackson are struggling without the support of a true WR1. 
Meanwhile, Prescott, Joe Burrow (when healthy) and Matthew Stafford have excelled because their rosters feature two WR1s.
It’s a matter of preference when deciding who’s ""best"" between the Cowboys, Bengals and Rams receiving corps. But with CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, Dallas is in consideration. That’s a big reason why Prescott looks as good as he has ever looked. He trusts his wideouts with every throw — in some cases too much, as we saw on Prescott’s foolish interception in the red zone.
But this offense proved it will never not be dangerous. Not even down 21 to the Eagles.
It’s probably too little too late for the Cowboys. They have a 9% chance of making the playoffs. They might have to win every game to do it. And they have the Chiefs on Thanksgiving before heading to Detroit for Week 14.
But perhaps Dallas can build a real contender around this offensive core in 2026. That will mean retaining George Pickens on a contract extension. And you’re crazy if you think Jerry Jones will make that process painless.
It doesn’t feel like people are taking the Patriots seriously as Super Bowl contenders, and that’s in large part because of their strength of schedule — or lack thereof. It’s hard to believe in Maye and the Patriots when their best wins have come over the Bills and the Buccaneers.
But Maye’s last game speaks to why New England might somehow be a dark horse. (Can you be a darkhorse when you’re also the No. 1 seed?)
That’s because this was one of his worst games in a while. Or, at the very least, this was one of his worst starts to a game in a while. Hit just three of his first seven passes for 16 yards and an interception. He was struggling with the pressure and seemed to think he could throw every pass off platform (in some cases for no apparent reason).
His wake-up call arrived with an interception that he simply airmailed to tight end Hunter Henry up the seam. There was really no explanation except: Bad, bad, bad throw.
""Probably mentally, not his best performance,"" Pats coach Mike Vrabel said after the game. 
Then things changed. Offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels got Maye throwing the ball quickly, with hot routes to beat the blitz and rollouts to get him working across the defense. He did finish the game struggling against man defense. But he also completed a few of the pinpoint passes — some downfield and some through tight windows — that have defined his season.
""They had some good stuff that I didn’t do well directing or get us in the right looks,"" Maye said. ""I have to be better at the line of scrimmage. Credit to them for catching us on some. I have to do my part to help us play cleaner football.""
The reason this performance felt encouraging was that Maye figured out how to beat what the Bengals threw at him. With more film on Maye, opposing defenses will have new challenges ready for him. Especially in the postseason. But he and the Patriots figured out how to work their way through their issues in real time. That might just be the most valuable skill in the playoffs. Of course, it’ll be a lot harder to pull that off against the Chiefs — rather than the Bengals.
But make no mistake: There was a silver lining to New England’s struggles.

83,2025-11-26,"The famous dot.com bubble burst 25 years ago, but its memory lives on, casting a shadow over the current bull market. Today’s bull is also fueled by tech..."
84,2025-11-26,"Yves here. Even though anyone who took a basic economics class learned that monopolists and oligopolists set prices higher than sellers do in competitive market, pols, pundits, and the press are bizarrely loath to point that out in real world situations. They seem to have been brainwashed that larger = more efficient, and that those efficiency savings will be in part passed on to customers. The post below is yet another demonstration that the companies in dominant positions can and do set dictate prices, and do so in times when inflation starts ticking up. It effectively proves the incorrectly-derided “greedflation” thesis.
Yet the authors made a point of not saying anything so direct. The original article headline was The granular origins of inflation. Since when does “granular” evoke “big”? Just read the overview paragraph below and see how they bafflegab their important findings.
By Santiago Alvarez-Blaser; Raphael Auer, Head, BISIH Eurosystem Centre Bank For International Settlements; Sarah Lein, Research Network Fellow CESifo; Faculty Member Swiss Finance Institute; Full Professor of Macroeconomics University Of Basel; and Andrei Levchenko, John W. Sweetland Professor of International Economics University of Michigan, Ann Arbor Originally published at VoxEU
Textbook monetary economics views inflation as fundamentally driven by aggregate shocks, such as money supply or policy rates. This column presents empirical evidence that inflation is highly granular – it is significantly influenced by the prices set by a small number of large firms. Based on an analysis of 2.9 billion barcode-level transactions spanning 16 economies, it shows that firm-level idiosyncratic shocks account for a substantial share of inflation variability in advanced economies. Granular forces were also a key driver of the 2021–22 inflation shock and are shown to slow down the transmission of monetary policy.
What is the role of large firms in aggregate inflation, and what are the causes and implications of such ‘inflation granularity’? Textbook monetary economics views inflation as fundamentally driven by aggregate shocks, such as money supply or policy rates (Woodford 2003, Galí 2015). While the literature models rich micro-level price adjustment heterogeneities, idiosyncratic firm behaviour is typically integrated out, leaving no role for individual firms in aggregate inflation. At the same time, following Gabaix’s (2011) seminal contribution, an influential strand of the macro literature has modelled theoretically and documented empirically that shocks to individual (large) firms can generate aggregate fluctuations.
In recent research (Alvarez-Blaser et al. 2025), we shed light on this issue. We analyse a multi-country home-scan dataset spanning roughly 2.9 billion barcode-level transactions and 16 advanced and emerging economies. Each item is linked to a producing firm and a product category, as well as a retailer.
We start by showing that the preconditions for granularity are present in the data, as expenditure is highly concentrated: in the average advanced economy, the top ten firms account for about 41% of sales and the top ten categories for around 48%. There is also a high degree of synchronisation of price changes within multi-product firms and within categories.
We next develop an additive decomposition of aggregate inflation into a macro component (i.e. country-level unweighted averages) plus granular residuals at the firm and category levels. Our decomposition generalises the conventional granular residual setup (e.g. Gabaix 2011, di Giovanni et al. 2014, Gabaix and Koĳen 2024) in two dimensions. First, we allow for multiple non-nested dimensions of granularity (firms, categories, and, in an extension, retailers). Second, a granular residual can arise either from idiosyncratic shocks to large firms or from differential responses of large firms to common shocks. 1 Our notion of granular residual explicitly allows for both of these driving forces. We document which one is more powerful in our context.
Figure 1 displays the high-level results of our analysis. At the macro level, the firm and category granular components account for 56% of the inflation variance in advanced economies over the 2005-2020 period (see the left-hand column of Figure 1). The firm granular residual is relatively more important, explaining some 41% of inflation variance. Twenty-six percentage points (dark red) are accounted for by the ten largest firms alone, and the remaining 15 percentage points by large firms that are not in the top ten (light red). The category granular residual accounts for an additional 15% of inflation variance (yellow area). We next decompose the granular residuals into the components due to the differential responsiveness to common shocks, and the idiosyncratic shocks. The firm granular residual is predominantly driven by idiosyncratic shocks. By contrast, more than half of the variability in the category granular residual is due to the categories’ differential responsiveness to common shocks.
Figure 1 Contributions of granular components to retail inflation variation

Granularities are a less important in emerging markets (see the right-hand column of Figure 1), where inflation is higher on average and market shares are less concentrated: the combined firm and category residual explains about 20% of inflation variance.
Market Share Concentration and Inflation Granularity
We next investigate how the cross-country differences in inflation granularity relate to market concentration in these countries. In particular, we relate the explanatory power of granular residuals to the market shares of the top firms. Figure 2 displays a scatterplot of the variance share in total inflation accounted for by the top ten firms against the average market share of the top ten firms in each country. There is a positive and statistically significant relationship, suggesting that granular effects are stronger in countries with higher market concentration.
Figure 2 Granularity and market concentration

This correlation suggests that trends in market concentration, as documented for example in Autor et al. (2020), may coincide with an increasing role of firm granularities in aggregate inflation dynamics.
The 2021–22 Inflation Surge
During the post-pandemic period, granular forces increased in relative importance in advanced economies. On average, the firm granular component accounts for a sizable fraction of the 2021–22 inflation rate, reflecting both idiosyncratic shocks and heightened sensitivity of large firms to common disturbances (e.g. supply bottlenecks, energy). This again highlights the role of large firms and multi-product price synchronization in amplifying macro shocks.
Figure 3 exemplifies these findings for Germany. Its shows overall inflation (solid line) split into the unweighted average (the macro component, dashed line) and the granular components (the sum of the firm and sectoral one). The figure shows that during the inflation surge, granular forces played a larger role.
Figure 3 Germany: Aggregate retail inflation and granular components – retailer dimension

Implications for Monetary Policy Effectiveness
A key policy result is that granularity alters the impulse response of inflation to contractionary monetary policy. In local projection estimates for the US and the euro area, aggregate inflation displays a short-run ‘price puzzle’, consistent with earlier evidence such as Christiano et al. (1999). This initial increase is almost entirely driven by the granular components, which together account for roughly three-quarters of the short-run rise. By contrast, the macro component does not raise inflation in the year following the monetary policy shock – it shows no significant response for about five quarters and then declines, in line with standard theoretical predictions. This implies that market concentration and the pricing behaviour of large firms can delay disinflation, weakening near-term transmission. Put differently, in more concentrated environments, monetary non-neutrality is shaped by the behaviour of a small set of large price-setters whose pass-through of financing and input-cost shocks may be stronger.
Figure 4 Impulse response functions for aggregate inflation and components

Conclusion
We show that inflation in advanced economies is highly granular, i.e. it is significantly influenced by the prices set by a small number of large firms.  In the cross-section of countries, granular residuals are less important in economies with less concentrated market shares and higher inflation, such as emerging markets. Granular residuals contributed to the post-COVID inflation surge, with the firm-level component accounting for roughly one-third of the 2021-2022 inflation in advanced economies.
Overall, these findings highlight that granular factors beyond traditional macroeconomic determinants matter greatly in shaping inflation, which also affects the effectiveness of monetary policy and hence the conduct of monetary policy. An operational takeaway is that granular price microdata of large firms and products are a valuable input for inflation nowcasting. The ECB’s Daily Price dataset and the BIS Innovation Hub’s Project Spectrum are examples of efforts to develop tools for real-time analytics and nowcasting based on detailed prices, improving signal extraction from inflation (BIS Innovation Hub 2025).

Textbook monetary economics views inflation as fundamentally driven by aggregate shocks, such as money supply or policy rates.  Oh, monetary economics.  Then there is the Joan Robinson textbook The Economics of Imperfect Competition.  Apparently and artifact now.  The Neo-classicists…hoist on their own petard.
In The Affluent Society Galbraith describes how in the post war economy, oligopolistic companies first set next years prices, then negotiated next years wages and then when wage increases were public they made next years wages public. 
For me that made something click. You know the common claim that companies pass on wage increases? But who can just pass on increases, weren’t prices supposed to be set by supply and demand? If companies has pricing power why would the wage increase matter except as a story to avoid protests?
I am shocked to learn that Hayek’s beloved businesses which, through effective competition and the efficiencies scaling up brings making it possible to offer higher quality goods at lower prices to the ultimate benefit of the consumer, relies on an incorrect assessment of the real world.  Perhaps this is why there is so much poverty going around.
“Granularity”? I don’t recall that term. It must be fairly new.. It is not in my copy of J is for Junk Economics, (Hudson, 2017). I did chuckle with sarcasm while reading this term several times in the article. 
But, I do recall an old-fashioned economics term rarely used nowadays: collusion (and price-fixing). This sort of thing may be hard to prove, but there appears to be lots circumstantial evidence. “Vertical integration”, monopsony, oligopoly, all appear to be working hand-in-hand to help price-gouging. (pun intended?)
Example: why are food prices higher in California when most of that food is produced in California? 
Then another situation comes to mind is where a “regulated” monopoly (see PG&E) has captured (bribed) the regulators to look the other way while they price-gouge a captive market. I know I repeat the term ad nauseam but institutionalized corruption is at play in a big way.
JFYI, publicly-owned SMUD (Sacramento Municipal Utility District) is adjacent to PG&E and is 35% cheaper. It’s C-suite is also not consulting with criminal attorneys about the possibility of facing charges of negligent homicide for their skimping on maintenance starting forest fires (that killed people).
Public ownership–it’s cheaper and better managed.
All industries are essentially cartels. It’s the five families for the win all over the economy. 
Anti monopoly law was inevitable for us steel. Eventually same for these d-bags. Maybe even in my lifetime at this rate. 
This time the boots to the throat economy is not different.

85,2025-11-26,"I'm an avid home cook and quite a fan of Costco.
In fact, I run a recipe blog and social account, Costco Kitchen, dedicated to making delicious dishes using ingredients from the wholesale retailer.
For the past decade or so, I've relied on my Costco shopping trips to stock up for hosting Thanksgiving dinner.
Offerings vary, but I can always find at least one great veggie tray at Costco. They typically come in a ready-to-serve plastic platter, which means one less dish for me to wash.
Simply peel off the plastic cover and set it out for your guests to enjoy.
This one from Taylor Farms has an assortment of colorful, crunchy, and cruciferous produce, plus a delicious ranch dip.
We usually serve Thanksgiving dinner around 4 p.m., so I like to set out small dishes and snacks for guests to have beforehand.
A charcuterie board is a great way to ensure no one gets too hungry or full before the main course.  
Costco offers premade flights and variety packs with assortments of cured meats or soft and hard cheeses, making it easy to customize a board.
Additionally, the chain offers lots of finishing touches to complement any charcuterie selection, including nuts, crackers, dried or fresh fruit, and olives. 
The sell-by dates for the turkeys usually fall after Thanksgiving, so you can purchase them relatively far in advance as long as you have the space in your refrigerator. 
If you shop at Costco a day or two before Thanksgiving, there's a chance the store may be sold out of your preferred size.
In my experience, the chain's turkeys can range from about 10 pounds to over 22.
If you're not cooking a whole turkey this year, you can also typically find precooked oven-browned turkey breast at Costco.  This is a great option for those who prefer white meat over dark. The turkey remains moist and juicy after getting warmed up in the oven.
It's also a great choice if you are serving ham, steak, or seafood as the main course, but would like to offer a small portion of traditional turkey. 
You can choose from a wide array of meats, such as rib-eye, prime rib, or a rack of lamb. 
Depending on the location and time of year, you may also find cold-water lobster tails. They can be poached in butter and served on their own or paired with steak for a classy Thanksgiving surf-and-turf.
At any other time of the year, you may find it difficult to justify purchasing 6 ½ pounds of potatoes. However, during the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, it just makes sense.
Costco offers a variety of options, including sweet potatoes, tiny mixed potatoes, and yellow potatoes. Use them to make plenty of your favorite mashed potatoes so guests can have seconds and take home leftovers.
I like to make a garlic mash or mashed sweet potatoes. 
I typically look for 2-pound bags of pre-snipped, washed, and ready-to-use green beans at Costco.
Once cooked, you can sauté the green beans in garlic, butter, and lemon and top them with Kirkland Signature Parmigiano-Reggiano or add them to a baking dish to make a casserole.
If I'm going with the latter, I also pick up a big bag of crispy onions at Costco to top my casserole with.
If you're short on time and need to add a few more sides to your Thanksgiving spread, consider looking for premade dishes at Costco, such as scalloped potatoes, mac and cheese , or roasted Brussels sprouts.
These sides are also great for those who lack oven space, as they can be easily heated up in the microwave, toaster oven, or air fryer.
One year, I grabbed trays of Chef Hak's seasoned, roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and cranberries.
The Kirkland Signature pumpkin pie is delicious — and it can feed up to 12 people for under $10.
I like to top the individual slices with whipped cream. Leftover slices also freeze well.
It's quite a popular item around Thanksgiving, so I highly recommend getting to Costco early before it sells out. 
Homemade whipped cream is superior, but these canisters can help you easily upgrade your pecan or pumpkin pie. 
If you decide to make the topper yourself, you can also find heavy whipping cream in Costco's refrigerator section.
Whether you're hosting Thanksgiving this year and want to dress up the house with seasonal decor or are attending as a guest and don't want to show up empty-handed, Costco is the place to go.
You can find beautiful bouquets of fresh-cut flowers for under $20, which is significantly less than what you'd probably pay at a local flower shop or online.
The retailer also tends to sell floral arrangements in decorative vases that can upgrade a Thanksgiving tablescape for under $25.
If you're looking for something a little more elevated than the run-of-the-mill paper plates you've been using for your backyard cookouts, then look no further than Costco.
Around this time of year, the chain typically offers a selection of elegant plastic plates and tableware that, at first glance, appears close to porcelain and silver.
In the past, I've seen Reflections cutlery sets with 160 pieces of heavyweight plastic silverware for under $11. I've also seen Kirkland Signature's elegant plastic plates priced at $10 for 50 dishes.
Once everyone has eaten their fill, I like to provide take-home containers so my guests can continue to enjoy their Thanksgiving leftovers after they leave. 
I can usually find take-away containers for a reasonable price at Costco. One year, I snagged a 25-pack of 38-ounce Glad meal-prep containers for under $10.

Target really needs a win this holiday season.
The company has struggled in recent years with declining comparable sales, and it has cautious expectations for the all-important fourth quarter of this year.
One aspect of the business that incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke is keenly interested in improving is making sure products are actually available on shelves for shoppers to buy.
""If you've trusted us with a trip to the store, we can't let you down by being out of stock, and we haven't been good enough over the last several years on that front,"" he said during a November earnings call.
Few days are more unforgiving of out-of-stocks than the day after Thanksgiving. Black Friday has changed a lot in recent years, but it's still the marquee sales event of the holiday shopping season.
That means stocking stores with the right quantities of toys, electronics, apparel, and other items.
The bullseye retailer invited Business Insider to take an exclusive look behind the curtain at one of its distribution centers, where merchandise from suppliers gets sorted and sent to individual stores across the region.
Target also fulfills more than 97% of its e-commerce orders from one of its retail stores, so that means almost everything the company sells online or offline must first pass through one of these distribution facilities.
Business Insider visited the warehouse a week before Thanksgiving and saw firsthand the overwhelming volume of items that go into ensuring each Target store has exactly what it needs each day.
Here's how Target is gearing up for the holiday rush.

87,2025-11-26,"Opera updated its AI-powered Neon browser today with a handful of welcome integrations and usability improvements. Here’s what’s new.
Since its introduction a couple of months ago, Opera Neon has been steadily picking up UX, UI, and under-the-hood upgrades to keep pace in the increasingly crowded AI-powered browser market.
Following the launch of the Opera Deep Research Agent (ODRA) last October, Opera Neon is rolling out today a ‘1-minute Deep Research’ mode:
“In the new one-minute-research mode, Opera Neon is dividing the problem as much as possible in order to employ as many ‘researchers’ as possible on the same task. This new mode for the deep research agent acts as a point in-between a simple AI query and a full-on deep research that turns useful since the user is not always in need of a full deep research for every query that requires a little bit more than just an AI overview. “
In addition to that, today’s update also introduces a model selector in Neon Chat, alongside the addition of Google’s Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro models. Interestingly, users can switch models mid-conversation, which is a nice addition.
Finally, Neon’s ‘Do’ agent now works with Google Docs, which the company says was one of the most-requested features. Here’s Opera:
“In order to create a Google Doc with Opera Neon users need to select the ‘Do’ agent in the browser’s omnibox and simply add to their prompt that they want to create a Google Doc. Additionally, users can also use Neon Do to edit an existing Google Doc, so they can request for the agent to add or subtract something – it will search the web for relevant information if needed – and they can even have it change the name of the document.“
Opera Neon requires a $19.99 monthly subscription. You can visit Opera Neon’s website to join the waitlist.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 41-year-old Jay Gengelbach, a software engineer from Boulder, Colorado, who lives in Canada. The following has been edited for length and clarity.
I joined Google as a software engineer straight out of college in 2006.
I loved telling people I worked at Google; it was a badge of honor that made me interesting.
After roughly 12 years there, I joined Verily, another Alphabet-owned company, in 2018, for six years.
At Verily, I earned up to $700,000, but in mid-2024, after growing unhappy in my job, I decided to resign, even if it meant a smaller salary. Making the jump was scary, but more than a year after quitting, the financial and emotional risk is starting to pay off.
This time of year can inspire people to reflect on their lives and careers and whether they're fulfilled, challenged, or ready for change. 
In Quitting Without Regret, Business Insider asked four people who quit great jobs to share what pushed them to act, how they managed doubt, and what they learned about risk and reward. 
Check out their stories below, and share yours here.
Google was a great place to work. We had wild benefits, nap pods, and free food. It was extravagant. Once, I saw employees having a luau-themed lunch, and it wasn't even a special holiday. On at least a couple of occasions, the company handed out $1,000 holiday bonuses to staff in cash.
Initially, I worked on software that helped keep the site up. After working in California for two years, I relocated to Colorado and stayed in that role for another two years. Even though I loved Google as a company, I became burned out and unsatisfied in my role.
I moved onto the payments team for four years before spending another four on the Google Now team, where I became a manager. I've learned I tend to get bored after doing the same thing after about four years.
In 2018, I got the opportunity to work at Verily, an Alphabet company focused on improving people's health with tech. I eventually became an engineering director there.
After six years, I became unhappy in my job. The pandemic and a period of layoffs were stressful. As a manager, I had to motivate my people, which I found challenging.
Somewhere along the way, I realized I didn't have work friends anymore. People used to have lunch with me for fun, but after I became a manager, eating with me was seen as networking. Not having peer relationships was very isolating.
I thought about going back to Google, but I realized it wasn't where I wanted to be. From what I saw and heard, layoffs in 2023 created a tangible shift in tone among employees. Layoffs were also happening at other Big Tech companies, and I was suspicious of working for them.
It was a fork in the road. For a long time, I didn't have to choose between what made me happy and what paid well, but I wasn't happy in my well-paid job, and I had to work out what I was going to do about it.
With support from my wife and therapist, I resigned from Verily in mid-2024. The tech market wasn't looking amazing, but I had enough savings to feel like I'd be OK if I were unemployed for one year.
Toward the end of my time at Verily, I was earning a total of around $700,000. I knew that matching that compensation would be really difficult outside Big Tech.
I feared I'd still be miserable in my next job, while making half the money.
When I started job hunting, I made a list describing my dream role, including compensation, location, and title. Ideally, I wanted an individual contributor position, instead of a manager role, and to be in an industry focused on making the world a better place.
In October 2024, I took up a remote position as a distinguished engineer for an insurance company. But in January, I moved to a software engineering job at a company called Vercel, which would allow me to relocate my family to Canada. I'd wanted to leave the US, so we moved to Canada in July 2025.
Vercel helps build hosting infrastructure for websites, which is a mission I feel good about, since excellent infrastructure helps businesses move faster.
After a long stint of feeling like I wasn't doing what I really wanted, I now feel like I'm solving hard problems again. Having an individual contributor role, instead of being a manager, means I get to flex muscles I hadn't used in a while. I'm also enjoying the quicker pace of delivering things at a smaller company.
My Big Tech salary allowed me to save a lot for my retirement, but it also meant my lifestyle inflated over time.
When I moved jobs, I knew that smaller companies often have smaller bonuses and equity than larger companies, so I'd have to make some lifestyle changes. We had a pool in our house, and it was expensive to maintain the property, so we had to get that albatross off our necks. When we moved to Canada, we downsized and scaled back on vacations.
Vercel recently announced a new funding round, which roughly tripled its valuation to $9 billion. This substantially impacts the value of my equity compensation. Although my equity is currently unvested and non-liquid, the decision I made to leave Big Tech has now started to feel less financially crazy than before.
At the same time, I've realized money doesn't buy happiness. I'm in a more fulfilling job and happier than I was when I was earning $700,000.
It wasn't that I needed that much money — there were points where I stuck to an annual budget and still had $100,000 left over — but I was afraid to discover what things were like without it. It was like breaking out of golden handcuffs.

89,2025-11-26,We recently published 11 Stocks Jim Cramer Shared His Insights On. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer discussed. Over...
90,2025-11-26,"The Mazda MX-5 Miata is proof that eye-watering horsepower does not make a sports car great. For many enthusiasts, a small, lightweight, sweet-handling, and rev-happy rear-wheel drive vehicle can beat a big, heavy, and complicated sports car. No wonder the Miata is the best-selling two-seater sports car in the world. 
The next-gen Miata will be even lighter than the ND and still offer a manual transmission, but it's the ND fourth-generation Miata that brought back the original's mojo. The good news for anyone interested in owning a Miata is that used ND Miata prices are dropping to reasonable levels. However, while the Miata is a fun car, it does come with its fair share of gremlins, and there are some details you need to keep an eye out for if you are in the market for one. 
First, you need to brush up on the differences between the ND1 (2016-2018) and ND2 (2019-2023). Both the ND1 and ND2 featured the same 2.0-liter naturally-aspirated Skyactiv G engine, but that's where the similarities end. The rev-happy ND1 engine delivered 155 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. It also had a relatively low 6,800-RPM redline. That changed for the ND2. The redline was raised to 7,500 RPM, and the engine featured lighter pistons and connecting rods, a stronger crankshaft, a bigger throttle body, and larger valves, all of which raised the output to 181 horsepower and 151 pound-feet of torque. It's not as cool, though, as a motorcycle-swapped Miata that revs up to 13,000 RPM. We also have the ND3, but finding one in the used car market is relatively rare, and if you do find one, it will be expensive.
Overall, both the ND1 and ND2 Miata engines are reliable and can easily cross 200,000 miles. However, the ND2 is considered to be slightly more reliable overall. One of the common issues with the engine in the ND1 in higher mileage cars is oil consumption, due to piston wear – it's not too much to be worrisome, but it is enough to require regular monitoring. Mazda also issued a recall on the ND1s for potential valve spring failure, so it makes sense to check if the used Miata you're looking at underwent the service. 
Another notable issue with the ND1 is worn-out transmission synchros. The second and third gears in the 6-speed gearbox are known to wear out, so keep an eye out for any grinding noise in these gears during a test drive. This issue was eliminated in the ND2, thanks to a completely redesigned transmission, which made the cars more reliable. 
The Skyactiv-G engine on both the ND1 and ND2 uses direct injection. High-mileage models suffer from carbon buildup on the valves that causes loss of performance. You can fix this issue with a walnut media blasting service.
Mazda models infamously suffer from soft paint, which is prone to chipping, and the Miata is no exception. Keep this in mind, as paint in special color-optioned cars will be expensive to fix. Getting a paint protection film (PPF) treatment is a good solution for these paint problems. While it's not a major issue in ND models, look out for signs of rust, especially if you are looking at a Miata from the Rust Belt.
Early ND models had an issue with the retractable fabric roof rubbing against the roll hoops, which, over time, can wear out the fabric. Keep an eye out for excessively worn fabric at those points. Later models feature redesigned hoops, which solved the problem.
Another issue with the ND, or for that matter, all soft-top Miatas, is clogged drains. Miatas have a drain channel to flush out water accumulating around the soft top roof. These empty out behind the front seat, and if the drain filter is clogged, water can get into the cabin, leading to soaked carpets and, worse, rusted floorboards. According to owners, the steel-roofed Retractable Fastback (RF) models are relatively trouble-free.
A common problem in ND Miatas is a knocking sound from the rear suspension. This is usually due to two possible issues. Some early Miata ND1 models had a clunking noise from the rear suspension, which was caused by the top two turns of the coil spring hitting one another when traveling over large bumps. Mazda did rectify this by installing rubber insulators between the turns, so it makes sense to check this if you are looking at an early ND1. 
Another reason for a clunk from the rear end while going over potholes could be worn-out hub carrier bushings. These are known to fail, due to what Miata owners call a design flaw. Mazda issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) for model years 2016 through 2021 that experience this problem. However, it's an expensive fix, as the entire hub needs to be replaced. A cheaper option, as recommended by some owners, is to replace the original spherical bushings with polyurethane versions. 
You should also check for general suspension wear. Miata dampers and struts usually last for around 100,000 miles, but they can fail as early as 50,000 miles if you drive rough. Most owners find it practical to perform a complete suspension overhaul around the 100,000-mile mark, so if you are looking at a high mileage Miata, this should be on your checklist. 
An inherent problem with the ND Miata is poor rear visibility, making reversing the car difficult. Mazda solved this issue by offering a rearview camera as standard equipment in the ND2 Miata. Another problem that is inherent with all Miata models is significant road noise. This is due to the cars' minimal use of sound insulation to keep weight in check, but excessive noise could also be a sign of worn-out door and window seals. Fortunately, the next-gen Miata could be a silent electric sportscar with a rotary range extender. 
Mazda Miata ND interiors are well built, but some owners have faced issues with premature wear of common interior touch points, like the steering wheel, gear shifter, and the seats. Some ND1 models have also had issues with the touchscreen infotainment system. The screen laminate can peel off over time, causing the screen to look foggy or cracked. That's not the only issue. Both ND1 and ND2 Miatas suffer from infotainment issues like a lagging interface and screen blackout. There is no permanent fix, but you can perform a factory reset to bring the system back to life. "
91,2025-11-26,"New supervisor juggling university and a retail job discovers training is mythical,, schedules change on a whim, and management thinks overtime is the solution when everything else fails. A job market held together with duct tape and denial, staffed by people who treat basic courtesy like an optional accessory tucked behind the lost-and-found counter. First day in, there's no onboarding, just a rotating calendar and endless requests to stick around after hours so someone can feign competence long enough to explain the job.
Hierarchy becomes a spectator sport when the resident supervisor greets newcomers with the warmth of a broken freezer, making entry-level leadership look like a parade of petty power trips and missed introductions. Schedules get updated by telepathy or crossed fingers, leaving everyone to guess when work's being done and whose weekend is about to evaporate. Turns out retail isn't a stepping stone to anything but mild existential dread and a waiting room for the next set of unreasonable demands.
Image is representative only and does not depict the actual subjects of the story.
Entry-level careers rarely come with parades, but this one hands out secondhand stress and a front-row seat to how not to motivate staff. Onboarding feels like an urban legend and the only thing clear at the end of the week is why nobody with options hangs around. Retail life in 2025: consider this a warning and a compliment to anyone still clocking in.

92,2025-11-26,"Sebi's primary market reforms panel is reviewing how company promoters are defined for IPOs. The committee proposes companies must justify their promoter identification in offer documents. This aims to prevent misleading investors by clarifying who truly controls a company. The panel suggests focusing on actual control rather than just shareholding. Upcoming discussions will shape new regulations for IPO disclosures.
The discussion paper said control should instead be determined under the Sebi takeover regulations, which spell out actual power to drive decisions in a company.

93,2025-11-26,"Apple sells over 200 million iPhones every year, but that's not enough for the company to be the world's top smartphone vendor every year. That title usually belongs to Samsung, whose smartphone mix helps it sell even more handsets than Apple. Unlike the iPhone maker, Samsung has several entry-level and mid-range models — giving it the ability to sell products to a large audience. Apple's cheapest iPhone is the $599 iPhone 16e. However, the iPhone 17 series is set to make Apple the world's top smartphone vendor in 2025, as per data from Counterpoint Research, Bloomberg reports. While the last time Apple outperformed Samsung was in 2011, Apple's iPhone strategy for the next few years might allow it to retain the top spot until 2029, according to this report. That said, analysts from Canalys and IDC have conflicting views, as the research firms had suggested that Apple had crushed Samsung, with the iPhone outshining the Galaxy in 2023.
The iPhone 17 series saw massive demand in the past two months, save for the ultra-thin iPhone Air. A separate Counterpoint Research report a few days ago highlighted how the iPhone 17 helped Apple grab 25% of the Chinese market in October. Additionally, the three iPhone 17 models were routinely sold out online, especially the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the standard iPhone 17 model. The cheaper model was a big success this year, thanks to several upgrades that make the base iPhone 17 almost as good a device as the iPhone 17 Pro.
The new Counterpoint Research figures highlighted by Bloomberg show that iPhone shipments will grow by 10% in 2025, compared to 4.6% for Samsung — with the entire smartphone market set to grow by 3.3% this year. With that, Apple is projected to capture 19.4% of the market. Analysts said that it's not just the strong iPhone 17 reception that's propelling Apple's phone sales. The replacement cycle has supposedly reached an inflection point, fueled by consumers who last purchased smartphones during the sales boom of the COVID period and are ready to upgrade. Also, the report noted that 358 million used iPhones were sold in the two years between the second quarter of 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. These iPhone owners are also likely to upgrade in the coming years to one of the new iPhones Apple is currently developing.
The Counterpoint Research analysts mention three rumored iPhone models set to launch in 2026 and 2027, including the budget iPhone 17e model, the foldable iPhone, and Apple's 20th-anniversary iPhone 20. These iPhones should launch in the spring of 2026, September 2026, and September 2027, respectively, according to previous rumors. Counterpoint Research believes that Apple's upcoming iPhone lineup will help Apple secure the world's top smartphone vendor title through 2029. If the prediction comes true, it'll give Apple a rare win over Samsung. That said, the Korean giant won't sit idle. Samsung is expected to hit back with the Galaxy S26 series early next year, followed by a new wave of foldable phones next summer."

96,2025-11-26,"South Korea's financial sector has been targeted by what has been described as a sophisticated supply chain attack that led to the deployment of Qilin ransomware.
""This operation combined the capabilities of a major Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) group, Qilin, with potential involvement from North Korean state-affiliated actors (Moonstone Sleet), leveraging Managed Service Provider (MSP) compromise as the initial access vector,"" Bitdefender said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
Qilin has emerged as one of the most active ransomware operations this year, with the RaaS crew exhibiting ""explosive growth"" in the month of October 2025 by claiming over 180 victims. The group is responsible for 29% of all ransomware attacks, per data from NCC Group.
The Romanian cybersecurity company said it decided to dig deeper after uncovering an unusual spike in ransomware victims from South Korea in September 2025, when it became the second-most affected country by ransomware after the U.S., with 25 cases, a significant jump from an average of about 2 victims per month between September 2024 and August 2025.
Further analysis found that all 25 cases were attributed exclusively to the Qilin ransomware group, with 24 of the victims in the financial sector. The campaign was given the moniker Korean Leaks by the attackers themselves.
While Qilin's origins are likely Russian, the group describes itself as ""political activists"" and ""patriots of the country."" It follows a traditional affiliate model, which involves recruiting a diverse group of hackers to carry out the attacks in return for taking a small share of up to 20% of the illicit payments.
One particular affiliate of note is a North Korean threat actor tracked as Moonstone Sleet, which, according to Microsoft, has deployed a custom ransomware variant called FakePenny in an attack targeting an unnamed defense technology company in April 2024.
Then, earlier this February, a significant pivot occurred when the adversary was observed delivering Qilin ransomware at a limited number of organizations. While it's not exactly clear if the latest set of attacks was indeed carried out by the hacking group, the targeting of South Korean businesses aligns with its strategic objectives.
Korean Leaks took place over three publication waves, resulting in the theft of over 1 million files and 2 TB of data from 28 victims. Victim posts associated with four other entities were removed from the data leak site (DLS), suggesting that they may have been taken down either following ransom negotiations or a unique internal policy, Bitdefender said.
The three waves are as follows -
An unusual aspect about these leaks is the departure from established tactics of exerting pressure on compromised organizations, instead leaning heavily on propaganda and political language.
""The entire campaign was framed as a public-service effort to expose systemic corruption, exemplified by the threats to release files that could be 'evidence of stock market manipulation' and names of 'well-known politicians and businessmen in Korea,'"" Bitdefender said of the first wave of the campaign.
Subsequent waves went on to escalate the threat a notch higher, claiming that the leak of the data could pose a severe risk to the Korean financial market. The actors also called on South Korean authorities to investigate the case, citing stringent data protection laws.
A further shift in messaging was observed in the third wave, where the group initially continued the same theme of a national financial crisis resulting from the release of stolen information, but then switched to a language that ""more closely resembled Qilin's typical, financially motivated extortion messages.""
Given that Qilin boasts of an ""in-house team of journalists"" to help affiliates with writing texts for blog posts and help apply pressure during negotiations, it's assessed that the group's core members were behind the publication of the DLS text.
""The posts contain several of the core operator's signature grammatical inconsistencies,"" Bitdefender said. ""However, this control over the final draft does not mean the affiliate was excluded from having a critical say in the key messaging or overall direction of the content.""
To pull off these attacks, the Qilin affiliate is said to have breached a single upstream managed service provider (MSP), leveraging the access to compromise several victims at once. On September 23, 2025, the Korea JoongAng Daily reported that more than 20 asset management companies in the country were infected with ransomware following the compromise of GJTec.
To mitigate these risks, it's essential that organizations enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), apply the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) to restrict access, segment critical systems and sensitive data, and take proactive steps to reduce attack surfaces.
""The MSP compromise that triggered the 'Korean Leaks' operation highlights a critical blind spot in cybersecurity discussions,"" Bitdefender said. ""Exploiting a vendor, contractor, or MSP that has access to other businesses is a more prevalent and practical route that RaaS groups seeking clustered victims can take.""
